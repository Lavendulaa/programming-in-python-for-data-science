# Concatenation

Up until this moment, we have been working with a single dataframe.  Single dataframes can be great to see all your data in one convenient place, however, this is less convenient when it comes to storage space.  Many companies split their data into multiple tables and join them together depending on what columns they need for their analysis.  
There are 2 different verbs we use for joining dataframes together: 

- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html" target="_blank">`pd.concat()`</a> -  A way of joining dataframes across rows or columns. 
- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.merge.html" target="_blank">`.merge()`</a> - This approach can only combine data on common columns or indices but have different types of joining methods.  We will look into this in the next section.

## Concatenation 

Concatenation works extremely well when you have similar dataframes where both share identical column or row index labels.  
`.concat()` can stich the 2 dataframes together either horizontally or vertically.

For the next couple of examples, we are going to look at our candy bars dataframe.

```{python}
candy = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', index_col=0)
candy
```

## Horizontal Concatenation

`candybars2.csv` has new nutritional information about each candy bar. 

```{python}
candy2 = pd.read_csv('candybars2.csv', index_col=0)
candy2
```

We want to combine `candy2` with `candy` horizontally.

Both `candy1` and `candy2` have 25 rows and it looks like the index name in the `candy2` dataframe is identical as `candy`.

We can combine these two dataframes using `pd.concat()` but we need to clarify which axes to combine. 
We use square brackets around the dataframes we wish to combine and since we are combining horizontally we need to use the argument `axis=1`. 

```{python}
pd.concat([candy, candy2], axis=1)
```

This results in the same 25 rows but now we have 13 columns.

## Vertical Concatenation

Our second example uses new dataset`candybars_more.csv` which has 3 additional candy bars that we wish to add to the original `candy` dataframe. 

```{python}
candy_more = pd.read_csv('candybars_more.csv', index_col=0)
candy_more
```

---

When we want to vertically combine dataframes, we use the argument `axis=0` with `pd.concat()`. 

```{python}
pd.concat([candy, candy_more], axis=0)
```

After combining them now have 28 rows and the same 10 columns that all align correctly.

## Concatenating incomplete dataframes.

`pd.concat()` is not limited to complete dataframes.  We can still add dataframes together that do not have all the same rows or columns.      
Let's take a selection of our `candy2` dataframe that we used to combine horizontally with `candy` and save it as `slice_of_candy2`.

```{python}
slice_of_candy2 = candy2.loc[['Coffee Crisp', 'Smarties', 'Take 5', 'Oh Henry']]
slice_of_candy2
```

---

What happens when we concatenate `candy1` and `candy2` now that it has fewer rows?

```{python}
pd.concat([candy, slice_of_candy2], axis=1)
```

If we scroll to the right we can see any rows that are not present in both dataframes are replaced with `NaN`.  That's because we are using a default argument `join='outer'`.

## The Join Argument

Ok so what does `join` do then? 
`pd.concat()` take a specific argument called `join` that can take the values `inner` or `outer`. 

- `inner`: Will return only the rows index values that are present in both the tables. 
- `outer`: Will return not only the rows that are present in both tables but also the rows in both tables that are unmatched.

Notice when I do the same join with `candy` and `slice_of_candy2` but this time specifying `join='inner`.

```{python}
pd.concat([candy, slice_of_candy2], axis=1, join='inner')
```

This only returns a dataframe with the matched rows from both columns.

One key thing to remember that if you want to save the new dataframe, don't forget to assign your new dataframe to an object name.  We did not do it in this section since we didn't need the new dataframes again! 
You'll likely want to reuse your new dataframe unlike us so don't forget to save the new product!
