# Wide and long dataframes

In the next few sections, we will explore two useful pandas functions for reshaping our data that can be handy to convert it into tidy data. 

- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.melt.html" target="_blank">`.melt()`</a> to make a wide dataframe long (convert columns to row) 
- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html" target="_blank">`.pivot()`</a>  to make a long dataframe wide (convert rows to columns)

Before going forward we should understand the difference between ***wide*** data and ***long*** data.

## Wide and long dataframes

**Wide**

We are used to seeing the cereal data in a wide format, where there is a column for each measured variable (e.g., calories, protein, sugar). We've already experienced that not all wide dataframes are tidy.

However the exact same information can be expressed in a structure called a **Long** dataframe.

**Long**  

A long dataframe would consist of the same information as contained in a wide dataframe, however in this case, for each data point, there is a row for each measurement. Similarly to how not all wide dataframes are tidy, neither are all long dataframes.

Can you see the difference? 

**Wide**

**Long**

As we discussed in the previous sections, tidy data is determined based on what we are trying to figure out, eg: what our statistical question is. 

There are cases where a long dataframe is considered tidy data and in other cases, a wide dataframe is tidy depending on what is being ask. 

Let's explore some examples.

We have some data obtain from the resource available <a href="https://github.com/jvcasillas/untidydata#language_diversity" target="_blank">here</a>. This shows the language diversity within different countries as well as their population and area.

We are trying to answer the statistical question ***what factors are associated with language diversity (as measured by the number of languages spoken in a country)?***

In this case, it makes the most sense for our data to have the measurements `area` and `population` as variables that may or may not affect language diversity. This would be considered tidy data stored as a wide dataframe.

Let's look at another example. 

Here is the UNICEF dataset on under-five child mortality  which is available <a href="https://sejdemyr.github.io/data-vis/mortality-wealth-time/" target="_blank">here</a>. It is based on data that can be found at www.childmortality.org. The under-five mortality rate is expressed as the number of under-five deaths per 1,000 live births.

The statistical question that we'd like to answer with this data set is: ***whether there a relationship between country and/or year on under-five child mortality?***

We are interested in the variable `year`. Having a single variable for year would be the most appropriate to use in our analysis and display tidy data.  This would  correspond to a long dataframe.
