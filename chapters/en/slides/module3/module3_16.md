Up until this moment, we have been working with a single dataframe.
Single dataframe can we great to see all your data in one convinient
place, however this is less convinient when it comes to storage space.
Many companyâ€™s split their data into multiple tables and join them
together depending on what columns they need for their analysis.  
There are 2 different verbs we use for joining dataframes together:

  - <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html" target="_blank">`pd.concat()`</a>;
    A way of joining dataframes across rows or columns.
  - <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.merge.html" target="_blank">`.merge()`</a>
    This approach can only combining data on common columns or indices
    but have different types of joining methods. We will look into this
    in the next section

## Concatenation

Concatenation works extremely well when you have similar dataframe where
both dataframes share identical column or row index labels.  
`.concat()`.

For the next couple examples we are going to look at our candybars
dataframe.

``` python
candy = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', index_col=0)

## Horizontal Concatination

`candybars2.csv` has new nutritional information about each candy bar
and we want to combine it with `candy` horozontally.

``` python
candy2 = pd.read_csv('candybars2.csv', index_col=0)
candy2
```

```out
                   calories   fat  sugar
name                                    
Coffee Crisp            260  13.0   25.0
Butterfinger            798  30.0   72.0
Skor                    209  12.0   23.0
Smarties                210   6.0   33.0
Twix                    250  12.0   25.0

Whatchamacallits        237  11.0   13.0
Almond Joy              234  13.0   24.0
Oh Henry                263  13.0   26.0
Cookies and Cream       220  12.0   13.0

[25 rows x 3 columns]
```

Both `candy1` and `candy2` have 25 rows and it looks like the index name
in the `candy2` dataframe is identical as `candy`.

We can combine these two dataframes using `pd.concat()` but we need to
clarify which axes to combine. We use square brackets around the
dataframes we wish to combine and since we are combining horonzontally
we need to use the argument `axis=1`.

``` python
pd.concat([candy, candy2], axis=1)
```

```out

This results in the same 25 rows but now we have 13 columns.

## Vertical Concatination

Our second example uses new dataset`candybars_more.csv` which has 3
additional candybars that we wish to add to the original `candy`
dataframe.

``` python
candy_more = pd.read_csv('candybars_more.csv', index_col=0)
candy_more
```

```out
              weight  chocolate  peanuts  caramel  nougat  cookie_wafer_rice  coconut  white_chocolate  multi available_canada_america
name

When we want to vertically combine dataframes, we us the
argument`axis=0` with `pd.concat()`.

``` python
pd.concat([candy,candy_more], axis=0)
```

```out

[28 rows x 10 columns]
```

In this situation we now have 28 rows and the same 10 columns that all
align correctly.

## Concatenating incomplete dataframes.

`pd.concat()` is not limited to complete dataframes. We can still add
dataframes together that do not have all the same rows or columns. Letâ€™s
take a selection of our `candy2` dataframe that we used to combine
horozontally with `candy`.

``` python
slice_of_candy2 = candy2.loc[['Coffee Crisp','Smarties', 'Take 5', 'Oh Henry']]
slice_of_candy2
```

```out
              calories   fat  sugar
name                               
Coffee Crisp       260  13.0   25.0
Smarties           210   6.0   33.0
Take 5             200  11.0   18.0
Oh Henry           263  13.0   26.0
```

What happens when we concatenate `candy1` and `candy2` now that it has
less rows?

``` python
pd.concat([candy, slice_of_candy2], axis=1)
```

```out

[25 rows x 13 columns]
```

Any rows that are not present in the both dataframes is replaced with
`NaN`. Thatâ€™s because we are using a default argument `join='outer'`

## The Join argument

Ok so what does `join` do then? `pd.concat()` take a specific argument
called `join` that can take the values `inner` or `outer`.

  - `inner`: inner join will returns only the rows index values that are
    present in both the tables.
  - `outer`: outer join will return not only the rows that are present
    in both tables but also the rows in both tables that are unmatched.

Notice now when I do the same join with `candy` and `slice_of_candy2`
but this time specifying `join='inner`.

``` python
pd.concat([candy, slice_of_candy2], axis=1, join='inner')
```

```

This only returns a dataframe with the matched rows from both columns.

One key thing to remember that if you want to save the new dataframe,
donâ€™t forget to assign your new dataframe to an object name. We did not
do it in this section since we didnâ€™t need need the new dataframes
again\! Youâ€™ll likely want to reuse your new dataframe unlike us so
donâ€™t foget to save the new product\!
