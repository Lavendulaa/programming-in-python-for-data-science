# Introduction to Functions

Functions may feel like we are introducing something new but we have been using them for the last 4 and a half modules. 

Back in Module 1, we compared functions and methods to verbs as they both complete actions.

`pd.read_csv()` is a function which reads in a dataframe:
```{python}
cereal = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv')
cereal.head()
```

And `sum()` is a function that adds all the values in a list: 
```{python}
addition = sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
addition
```

## Functions and the DRY principle 

In the last section, we discussed how loops helped avoid redundant code.    
We converted this code that creates a new list containing the square of the elements:

```{python}
numbers = [ 2, 3, 5]
squared = list()

squared.append(numbers[0] ** 2)
squared.append(numbers[1] ** 2)
squared.append(numbers[2] ** 2)
squared
```
into this:
```{python}
squared = list()
for number in numbers: 
    squared.append(number ** 2)
squared
```

This has helped us with some repetition, but what happens if we want to do the same process to multiple lists all named differently?

</audio></html>

---

Perhaps I have 3 other lists that I want to do the same operations on? 

```{python}
larger_numbers = [5, 44, 55, 23, 11]
promoted_numbers = [73, 84, 95]
executive_numbers = [100, 121, 250, 103, 183, 222, 214]
```


Notes: Script here

<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Now I will have to ***repeat*** the same code just so it applies to these lists too. 

```{python}
larger_numbers_squared = list()
for number in larger_numbers: 
    larger_numbers_squared.append(number ** 2)
larger_numbers_squared
```


```{python}
even_larger_numbers_squared = list()
for number in promoted_numbers: 
    even_larger_numbers_squared.append(number ** 2)
even_larger_numbers_squared
```


```{python}
extra_larger_numbers_squared = list()
for number in executive_numbers: 
    extra_larger_numbers_squared.append(number ** 2)
extra_larger_numbers_squared
```

This definitely violates the DRY principle. The question now is "Is there a better way?" and luckily there is!

Just like how we used functions like `pd.read_csv()` and `len()`, we have the ability to make our own.  

We can convert the code in the last slide, into our very own function and use it like we use built in ones. 

```{python}
def squares_a_list(numerical_list):
    new_squared_list = list()
    
    for number in numerical_list:
        new_squared_list.append(number ** 2)
    
    return new_squared_list
```

```{python}
numbers = [ 2, 3, 5]
squares_a_list(numbers)
```

## Syntax

```{python}
def squares_a_list(numerical_list):
    new_squared_list = list()
    
    for number in numerical_list:
        new_squared_list.append(number ** 2)
    
    return new_squared_list
```


Let's take a look at the structure: 

<center><img src='/module5/function-def.png' width="55%"></center>

- `def`: This is a python keyword that tells Python that anything indented after this belongs to a function. 
- **Function name**: Like any object, we need to give our function a name.  In our case, we have named our function `squares_a_list`.  We cannot name it any existing function names. 
- **Parameters/Arguments**: Python calls these parameters however, we have been calling these arguments.  This is what the function needs as an input in order for it to do any actions.  We can have multiple parameters as well.  In our function, we have a single parameter named `numerical_list`.
- **Colon**: Just like loops and conditionals, a function required its first defining line to end with a colon.

In the body a function, all the code is indented 4 spaces and further indented for loops and conditions.      
The `return` statement is crucial to a function for returning a desired output.  Here, our function returns a new list.  If the function does not return anything then you won't get a value to assign to an object. It does all the work, but never sends the result back to the code that called it.

```{python}
def not_a_great_function(numerical_list):
    new_squared_list = list()
    for number in numerical_list:
        new_squared_list.append(number ** 2)
    new_squared_list
```

```{python}
not_a_great_function([1, 2, 3])
```

(See no value is returned!)

---

```{python}
def squares_a_list(numerical_list):
    new_squared_list = list()
    
    for number in numerical_list:
        new_squared_list.append(number ** 2)
    
    return new_squared_list
```

We can now call this function as we did with other verbs and use each of our lists of interest as the input argument: 

```{python}
numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
squares_a_list(numbers)
```



Notes: Script here

<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We can reuse this function on all our other lists as well, while still meeting our DRY principle:

```{python}
larger_numbers = [5, 44, 55, 23, 11]
squares_a_list(larger_numbers)
```

```{python}
promoted_numbers = [73, 84, 95]
squares_a_list(promoted_numbers)
```

```{python}
executive_numbers = [100, 121, 250, 103, 183, 222, 214]
squares_a_list(executive_numbers)
```

Notes: Script here

<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

You could get even more fancy, and put all the lists of numbers into a list (so you have a list of lists).
Then you could loop over the list and call the function each time:

```{python}
numbers = [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
larger_numbers = [5, 44, 55, 23, 11]
promoted_numbers = [73, 84, 95]
executive_numbers = [100, 121, 250, 103, 183, 222, 214]
```



```{python}
for list_of_numbers in [numbers, larger_numbers, promoted_numbers, executive_numbers]:
    print(squares_a_list(list_of_numbers))
```

## Designing Good Functions

There is some ambiguity for how and when to design a function.  
For instance:        
- Should `squares_a_list()` be a function if I'm only ever using it once?  Twice?
- Should the loop be inside the function, or outside?

This comes down to personal opinion. 

Some may say that the function `squares_a_list()` does a bit too much to keep things understandable. 

Designing effective functions will be discussed in the next section.
