# Making choices with conditionals

In the last Module, we explored using different data structures and types that Python offers. It's at this point in the course where we learn how to ask Python to take different actions, depending on a condition, from these structures. 

We did something similar when we filtered a dataframe using condition such as:

```{python}
cereal[cereal['mfr'] == 'K']
```

Let's start with an example of what the syntax looks like.

Perhaps we want to introduce ourself in our code by using the object called `my_name`. Here we use a verb called `print()` that simply prints the object or string set as it's argument: 
```{python}
my_name = 'Hayley' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
   print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
  print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
  print('Nice to meet you!')
```

We can see that since the object `my_name` is equal to `hayley`, so it makes sense that the output is `My name is Hayley too`.

## Syntax  

```{python}
my_name = 'Hayley' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
   print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
  print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
  print('Nice to meet you!')
```


Python conditional statements contains 2 important things:    

 - A strict structure. 
 - The keyword `if` and optional keywords `else` and `elif`.

## Structure 

```{python}
my_name = 'Hayley' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
   print('My name is Hayley too!')
```

The structure of a choice is as follows: 

```python
Some conditional expression:
    statement body 
```

Each conditional expression must end with a colon `:` and  any code directed at values that meet the expression,  all must be indented with 4 spaces.      
In the example above,       
`if my_name.lower() == 'hayley'` is the conditional expression and,      
`print("My name is Hayley too!")` is the statement body.

#### Keywords

- An `if` expression is needed for any conditional.  If the expression is true, the body of the statement (anything indented under it) will be executed. If the expression is false, the body of the statement is not executed and it continues to the next line of code outside the body of the if condition.    
- The `else` expression will execute if the conditional expressions above it are false. Unlike `if` which can be executed many times, `else` can only occur once following an `if` condition.

`else` statements are optional. If you don't want to assign a default value, the code will still work without one. 


```{python}
my_name = 'Hayley' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
   print('My name is Hayley too!')
```

- `elif` stands for ***else if***. It allows us to check multiple conditions for true.
- When the `elif` expression evaluates to true, then the body of the statement is executed, just like an `if` statement.
- Unlike `else`, we can use as many `elif` statements in a decision process as we want.
- `elif` statements **MUST** follow an `if` statement or an error will occur.


```python
my_name = 'Hayley' 

elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print("Interesting, I loved that movie!")
```

```out
Error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 2)
```

Let's look at the example in the diagram below: 

<center><img src='/module5/condition1.png' width="37%"></center>

We can look at each `if` and `elif` condition as a filter. For an object that is <b><font color="#ea92b9">pink</font></b> , the body of the `if` statement will execute and not see any further conditions down the funnel.     
For a <b><font color="#a4cff4">blue</font></b>  object, the item will have seen the `if` condition but because it did not result in a true value, it continued down the funnel. Since the `elif` condition results in a true statement, it will not proceed to the `else` condition's body.     
<b><font color="#53d3dc">Any other colour</font></b>  will pass the 2 conditions and proceed to the default `else` statement's body.

## Order matters

The order we chose for the statement for the `if` and `elif` statements is important and can result in different outputs.
Let's explore this in the next example:

```{python}
item = 12 

if item > 10:
    magnitude = 'greater than 10'
elif item > 20:
    magnitude = 'greater than 20'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```

In this case, our `item` value is greater than 10 so our first condition, holds true. But let's see what happens with an `item` value of 22. 

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python}
item = 22 

if item > 10:
    magnitude = 'greater than 10'
elif item > 20:
    magnitude = 'greater than 20'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```

The item is taken out of the stream at the first `if` condition and so it doesn't get a chance to see the `elif` statement even though it would result in a true value.

This can be fixed by rearranging the conditional statements:

```{python}
item = 22 

if item > 20:
    magnitude = 'greater than 20'
elif item > 10:
    magnitude = 'greater than 10'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```

Now a value of 22 give the correct output, but what about a value of 12?

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python}
item = 12 

if item > 20:
    magnitude = 'greater than 20'
elif item > 10:
    magnitude = 'greater than 10'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```

Since 12 doesn't meet the first condition, it passes it, and moves onto the second condition which it does meet.

## In line

In situation where we have only `if` and `else` statements, we have a nice ability to put it all in a single line of code.
We have a given object, in this case we are using a list of words named `words`: 
```{python}
words = ['the', 'list', 'of', 'words']
```

The original conditional statements below checks if the list is longer than 10 elements or not and gives it a `list_size` value. 

```{python}
if len(words) > 10:
    list_size = "long list"
else:
    list_size = "short list"
list_size
```

The 4 lines used for the conditional statements can be compressed into a single one:

```{python}
list_size = "long list" if len(words) > 10 else "short list"
list_size
```

Both syntaxes are acceptable depending on your preference.

### Python Keyword "in"  

Up to this point, we have been using equalities and inequalities for our conditions, but we are not restricted to this. There are many different keywords we can use in conditional statements but one that you may use often is `in`. 

We can use `in` to check if a certain value is contained in a list or dictionary:
```{python}
exercises = ['burpees', 'lunges', 'squats', 'curls', 'deadlifts']

if 'squats' in exercises:
  sore = True
else:
  sore = False
  
sore
```
