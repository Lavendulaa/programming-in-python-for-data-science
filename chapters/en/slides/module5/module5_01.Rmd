# Making choices with conditionals

In the last Module, we explored using different data structures and types that Python offers.  It's at this point in the course where we learn how to ask Python to make a decision, depending on conditions.

We did something similar when we filtered a dataframe using condition such as:

```{python}
cereal[cereal['mfr'] == 'K']
```

Let's start with an example of what the syntax looks like.

Perhaps we want to introduce ourselves in our code by using the object called `my_name`.  Here we use a verb called `print()` that simply prints the object or string set as an argument: 
```python 
my_name = 'Hayley' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')

```

```out
My name is Hayley too!
Nice to meet you!
```

We can see that since the object `my_name` is equal to `hayley`, the output is `My name is Hayley too`.  It then continues to run the code `'Nice to meet you!` which is outside any conditions.

Now what happens if the object was equal to something else? 

```python
my_name = 'Totoro' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')

```

```out
Interesting, I loved that movie!
Nice to meet you!
```

The object `my_name` has a different value now, so the output corresponds to a different `print()` statement.  This time it prints `Interesting, I loved that movie!` and the code `Nice to meet you!` that follows the conditions.

Now we try something that meets neither of those conditions:

```python 
my_name = 'Desmond' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')

```

```out 
That's a great name.
Nice to meet you!
````

When `my_name`  is `Desmond` the last possible output is returned and prints `That's a great name.`.  It resumes and executes the code underneath as did each of the other values.

## Syntax  

```python
my_name = 'Hayley' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')

```

```out
My name is Hayley too!
Nice to meet you!
```

Python conditional statements contains 2 important things:    

 - A strict structure. 
 - The keyword `if` and optional keywords `else` and `elif`.

---

## Structure 

```{python}
my_name = 'Hayley' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
```

The structure of a choice is as follows: 

```python
if SOME_BOOLEAN:
    statement body 
```

Each conditional expression must end with a colon `:` and any code directed at values that meet the expression,  all must be indented with 4 spaces (or consistent indentation) .      
In the example above,       
`if my_name.lower() == 'hayley'` is the boolean statement 
`print("My name is Hayley too!")` is the statement body.

#### Keywords

- An `if`  is needed for any conditional.  If the boolean value is `True`, the body of the statement (anything indented under it) will be executed.  If the expression is `False`, the body of the statement is not executed and it continues to the next line of code outside the body.    
- The `else` expression will execute if the conditional expressions above it are false. `else` can only occur once following an `if` condition.

`else` statements are optional. 


```python
my_name = 'Mia' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
   print('My name is Hayley too!')

print('Nice to meet you!')
```

```out 
Nice to meet you!
```

---

- `elif` stands for ***else if***.  It allows us to check multiple conditions if they are true.

- When the `elif` expression evaluates to true, then the body of the statement is executed, just like an `if` statement.


In the case we saw before, `my_name.lower() == 'totoro'` is the second condition which evaluates to "True": 

```python
my_name = 'Totoro' 

if my_name.lower() == 'hayley':
    print('My name is Hayley too!')
elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print('Interesting, I loved that movie!')
else:
    print("That's a great name.")
  
print('Nice to meet you!')

```

```out
Interesting, I loved that movie!
Nice to meet you!
```

- Unlike `else`, we can use as many `elif` statements in a decision process as we want.

- `elif` statements **MUST** follow an `if` statement or an error will occur.


```python
my_name = 'Hayley' 

elif my_name.lower() == 'totoro':
    print("Interesting, I loved that movie!")
```

```out
Error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 2)
```

## Order matters

The order we chose for the statement for the `if` and `elif` statements is important and can result in different outputs.
Let's explore this in the next example using inequalities with numbers:

```{python}
item = 13 

if item > 10:
    magnitude = 'Between 10 and 20'
elif item > 20:
    magnitude = 'Greater than 20'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```

In this case, our `item` value is greater than 10 so our first condition holds true.  But let's see what happens with an `item` value of 25. 

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python}
item = 25 

if item > 10:
    magnitude = 'Between 10 and 20'
elif item > 20:
    magnitude = 'Greater than 20'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```

The item is taken out of the stream at the first `if` condition and so it doesn't get a chance to see the `elif` statement even though it would result in a true value.

This can be fixed by rearranging the conditional statements:

```{python}
item = 25 

if item > 20:
    magnitude = 'Greater than 20'
elif item > 10:
    magnitude = 'Between 10 and 20'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```

Now a value of 25 gives the desired output of `greater than 20`, but what about a value of 13?

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python}
item = 13 

if item > 20:
    magnitude = 'Greater than 20'
elif item > 10:
    magnitude = 'Between 10 and 20'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
 
magnitude
```

Since 13 doesn't meet the first condition, it passes it and moves onto the second condition which it does meet.

## Inline

In situations where we have only `if` and `else` statements, we have the ability to put it all in a single line of code.
Let's test this on our object `item`:
```{python}
item = 13
```

The original conditional statements below checks if the item is greater than 10 designating an object with the value `greater than 10` if it is and `10 or less` otherwise: 

```{python}

if  item > 10:
    magnitude = 'Greater than 10'
else:
    magnitude = '10 or less'
    
magnitude
```

The 4 lines used for the conditional statements can be compressed into a single one:

```{python}
list_size = "Greater than 10" if item > 10 else "10 or less"
list_size
```

Both syntaxes are acceptable depending on your preference.

### Python Keyword "in"  

We've already seen that conditions evaluate to a boolean. So far we've seen a lot of boolean evaluated from equalities and inequalities but that's not all. 

There are many different keywords we can use in to obtain a boolean value but one that you may use often is `in`. 

We can use `in` to check if a certain value is contained in a list or dictionary:
```{python}
exercises = ['burpees', 'lunges', 'squats', 'curls', 'deadlifts']

'squats' in exercises
```

And we can pair this with `if` to make a condition statement like we did before:

```{python}
if 'squats' in exercises:
    sore = True
else:
    sore = False
sore
```
