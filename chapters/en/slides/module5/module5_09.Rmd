# Range and comprehensions

## Range 

Often, we just want to do something 5 times without looping over a collection. The most common way to do that is to use `range()`, which automatically generates a collection of the integers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or in general 0, 1, ..., N-1 .

```{python}
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
We can also specify a _start value_, an _end value_ and a _skip-by value_ with range:

```{python}
for i in range(50, 101, 10):
    print(i)
```

The format is the starting integer first, the ending integer next and the skip by integer last.  Similarly to slicing with `.iloc[]` in pandas, the starting point of `range()` is *inclusive* in the sequence and the ending number is *exclusive*.  

```python
range(start, end, skip)
```

The skip-by variable is optional.  In `range()`, the default skip number is 1, so if we don't include it, Python will assume to increase in increments of 1. 

```{python}
for i in range(7,10):
    print(i)
```
If we only include a single integer in the function, a sequence up to the given number (not including it) will be generated starting from `0`.

```{python}
for i in range(4):
    print(i)
```

`range()` only works for integers.  If we attempt a loop with type `float`, an error will occur: 

```{python, error=TRUE}
for i in range(0.5,1.0,0.1):
    print(i)
```

## Looping in a dictionary

We can also loop over the key-value pairs of a dictionary using `.items()`. 

```{python}
cereals = {'Special K': 4, 'Lucky Charms': 7, 'Cheerios': 2, 'Wheaties': 3}
cereals.items()
```


Since each key-value pair has 2 elements in it, we need 2 specify 2 variables for each item in `cereal.items()` - One for the `key` in this case the cereal name, and one for the value - the cereal stock total. 


```{python}
cereals = {'Special K': 4, 'Lucky Charms': 7, 'Cheerios': 2, 'Wheaties': 3}

for cereal, stock in cereals.items():
    print( cereal  + " has " + str(stock) + " available")
```

## Comprehensions

We learned in the last Module that we can make and `if`/`else` condition in a single line of code and we can do something similar with basic loops. 
**Comprehensions** allow us to build lists/sets/dictionaries in one convenient, compact line of code.

As an example, let's count the number of letters in each element of a list.  The list comprehension can be done as so:
```{python}
numbers = [ 2, 3, 5]

squared = [number ** 2 for number in numbers]
squared
```

We saw in the last section that to obtain the same resulted required the following code: 

```{python}
squared = list()

for number in numbers: 
    squared.append(number ** 2)
    
squared
```

Dictionary comprehensions can be done in a similar way but this time we wrap the line with curly brackets and specify what our keys and values are: 
In this case we assign the number as the key and the square of it as the value. 

```{python}
numbers = [ 2, 3, 5]

word_length = {number : number ** 2 for number in numbers}
word_length
```

Both methods of building lists and dictionaries work and it's down to you to decide what works better for you.
