# Range and comprehensions

## range 

Instead of looping over items in a collection, we can iterate over a sequence of numbers.  `range()` is a verb that generates a sequence of integers up to some value.

```{python}
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
We can also specify a _start value_, an _end value_ and a _skip-by value_ with range:

```{python}
for i in range(50, 101, 10):
    print(i)
```

The format is the starting integer first, the ending integer next and the skip by integer last.  Similarly to slicing with `.iloc[]` in pandas, the starting point of `range()` is *inclusive* in the sequence and the ending number is *exclusive*.  

```python
range(start, end, skip)
```

The skip-by variable is optional.  In `range()`, the default skip number is 1, so if we don't include it, Python will assume to increase in increments of 1. 

```{python}
for i in range(7,10):
    print(i)
```
If we only include a single integer in the function, a sequence up to the given number (not including it) will be generated starting from `0`.

```{python}
for i in range(4):
    print(i)
```

`range()` only works for integers.  If we attempt a loop with type `float`, an error will occur: 

```{python, error=TRUE}
for i in range(0.5,1.0,0.1):
    print(i)
```

## Comprehensions

We learned in the last Module that we can make and `if`/`else` condition in a single line of code and we can do something similar with basic loops. 
**Comprehensions** allow us to build lists/tuples/sets/dictionaries in one convenient, compact line of code.

As an example, let's count the number of letters in each element of a list.  The list comprehension can be done as so:
```{python}
numbers = [ 2, 3, 5]

squared = [number ** 2 for number in numbers]
squared
```

We Saw in the last section that to obtain the same resulted required the following code: 

```{python}
squared = list()

for number in numbers: 
    squared.append(number ** 2)
    
squared
```

Dictionary comprehension can be done in a similar way but this time we wrap the line with curly brackets and specify what our keys and values are: 
In this case we assign the number as the key and the square of it as the value. 

```{python}
numbers = [ 2, 3, 5]

word_length = {number : number ** 2 for number in numbers}
word_length
```

Both methods of building lists and dictionaries work and it's down to you to decide what works better for you.
