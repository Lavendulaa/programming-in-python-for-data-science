# Nested loops

We've seen how loops can help us adhere to the DRY principle, but what can we do if we are already using a loop and there is still repetition?     
For example: Let's say we are trying to obtain all the red (♥️, ♦️) suited face cards from a deck of cards into a list.

```{python}
suits = ["❤︎","♦"]
faces = ['Jack', 'Queen', 'King']

cards = [ ]
for suit in suits:
    cards.append(faces[0] + ' of ' + suit)
    cards.append(faces[1] + ' of ' + suit)
    cards.append(faces[2] + ' of ' + suit)
cards
```

We are currently using a loop but we keep repeating the same `faces[#] + ' of ' + suit` line. 

In these types of situations, we can reduce redundancy by... you guessed it, adding another loop!

Just like how we reduced the repetition by making a first loop we can make a second loop within the first one. 
```{python}
suits = ["❤︎","♦︎"]
faces = ['Jack', 'Queen', 'King']

cards = [ ]
for suit in suits:
    for face in faces: 
        cards.append(face + ' of ' + suit)
cards
```

This is called a **nested loop** since we have a loop *nested* in an existing one.

Let's see exactly what is happening:

```{python}
cards = [ ]
for suit in suits:
    print(suit)
    for face in faces: 
        print(face)
        cards.append(face + ' of ' + suit)
cards
```
By looking at the output, we notice that all the heart(♥️) face cards are added to the list first.  That means the first iteration of the outer loop waits for the inner loop to finish going through all the faces before starting the next suit iteration.  Python then re-iterates over the inner loop again for the second item (♦️) in the outer loop. 

The outer loop cannot move onto its next iteration until the inner loop has reached the last item in its collection.

Let's try another example: 

In this case, we are given a list containing lists as elements that we wish to "flatten" into a new list that contains all the individual elements. 

```{python}
rhyme = [[1, 2, 'buckle my shoe'], [3, 4, 'slam the door'], [5, 6, 'pick up sticks']]

all_words = list()
for verse in rhyme: 
    for word in verse: 
      all_words.append(word)
all_words 
```

For each of the lists in `rhyme`,  we go through a loop to append each element in `verse` to a new list object named `all_words`. 
This sounds like a mouthful so let's clear this up.    
We use a loop to iterate over each list in the `rhyme` object.   
We use a second loop to iterate over each element in the `verse` list.
