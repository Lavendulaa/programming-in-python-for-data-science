## Repeating Code 

There are times where we may want to repeat the same action multiple times. 
Let's say we want to add the square of every number in a list to a new list. 

```{python}
numbers = [2, 3, 5]
```

We would have to do something like the following: 

```{python}
squared = list()

squared.append(numbers[0] ** 2)
squared.append(numbers[1] ** 2)
squared.append(numbers[2] ** 2)
squared
```


This is problematic for numerous reasons.

Some of the reasons this exhibits bad coding practices are as followed: 

- **Difficult to scale**: It only works for a list with 3 elements.  If we want to do this for a list of a different length, we need to add or remove code. 

- **Difficult to modify**: If we want to change its functionality, we need to change 3 similar lines of code.

- **Clarity**: It is hard to understand what it does just by looking at it.

## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY Principle) 

Just like how we try to reduce, reuse and recycle waste, coding likes to borrow a similar principle aimed at reducing repetitive code.

This motion is called the ***DRY principle*** otherwise known as the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle.  This premise of this principle to avoid redundancy within code. 

The method we discussed in the last slide is a violation of this principle (known as a ***WET Solution ("write every time")***).  There is a much more efficient method to obtain the same output that avoids typing out multiple iterations of similar code.

## Loops

Our example before takes 3 lines of code to add all the squared values to `squared` and violates the DRY principle in the process: 

```{python}
squared = list()

squared.append(numbers[0] ** 2)
squared.append(numbers[1] ** 2)
squared.append(numbers[2] ** 2)
squared
```

Instead, we can add to the list `squared` by using something called a **loop** to repeat the  `.append()` action over the multiple elements:

```{python}
squared = list()
for number in numbers: 
    squared.append(number ** 2)
squared
```
 
This only took 2 lines of code but if the number of elements in the list increase, the code remains the same. Think how much code writing we would avoid if the list had a length of 1000?!

## For (Each) Loop 

```{python}
squared = list()
for number in numbers: 
    squared.append(number ** 2)
squared
```

This specific loop is called a ***For loop*** and can be iterated over any type of *collection/sequence*: list, tuple, and string.    
In this case, it's over the values in a list. 


Every line of code that is indented,is executed for each value in the list (hence the name "for" loops, sometimes also called "for each" loops).     
The loop ends after the variable has iterated over all the values in the collection.

Before entering the loop, we make an empty list named `squared`:

```{python}
squared = list()
numbers = [ 2, 3, 5]

for number in numbers: 
    squared.append(number ** 2)
squared
```

Our loop begins with the keyword `for` and we make a new variable named `number`. This refers to an element in the list  `numbers`. We could name this new variable anything so long as we reference the same name later on in the loop.

```{python}
squared = list()
numbers = [ 2, 3, 5]

for thingamajig in numbers: 
    squared.append(thingamajig ** 2)

squared
```

You see how we changed the variable name in the construction of the loop as well as in the `.append()`?

```{python}
squared = list()

for number in numbers: 
    squared.append(number ** 2)

squared
```

Loops have a similar structure to conditions in that the first line must end with a colon (`:`) and everything within the loop must have a 4-space indentation to differentiate it from code outside the loop.

We first start with the first number in `numbers`. We calculate the square of `2` as `4` and append it to the empty list called `squared`.

When we have finished all the code for the first element, we move to the second one valued at `3`. We calculate the square of `3` as `9` and append it to the existing list `squared`:

---

We then move onto the last element valued at `5`. Square the number `5` as `25` and append it to the existing list `squared`.  This is where the loop ends since there are no more values in the list `numbers` and so it executes the next line of code which is displaying object `squared`.
