## Repeating Code 

There are times where we may want to repeat the same action multiple times. 
Let's say we want to add the square of every number in a list to a new list. 

```{python}
not_squared_list = [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

We would have to do something like the following: 

```{python}
squared_list = []

squared_list.append(not_squared_list[0] ** 2)
squared_list.append(not_squared_list[1] ** 2)
squared_list.append(not_squared_list[2] ** 2)
squared_list.append(not_squared_list[3] ** 2)

squared_list
```


This is problematic for numerous reasons including that it's time consuming for long list.

Just like how we try to reduce, reuse and recycle waste, Python can reuse and recycle code by repeating the interation in something called a loop.

```{python}
not_squared_list = [ 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

We can create the same `squared_list` by looping over the same action:

```{python}
squared_list = []

for element in not_squared_list: 
  squared_list.append(element ** 2)

squared_list
```
 
 This only took 2 lines of code. Think how much code writing we would avoid if the list had a length of 100?!

Let's take a closer look at the loop we just made:

```{python}
squared_list = []

for element in not_squared_list: 
  squared_list.append(element ** 2)

squared_list
```

We start our loop with `for` and we created a new variable named `element`. This refers to an item in the collection of items that we are iterating over.  We could name this new variable anything so long as we reference the same name later on in the loop.
For example the code below would also run:

```{python}
squared_list = []

for thingamajig in not_squared_list: 
  squared_list.append(thingamajig ** 2)

squared_list
```

You see how we changed the variable name in the `.append()` verb as well?

```{python}
squared_list = []

for element in not_squared_list: 
  squared_list.append(element ** 2)

squared_list
```

For loops has a similar structure to conditions in that the first line must end with a colon (`:`) and everything within the loop must have a 4 space indentation to differentiate it from code outside the loop.

## For (Each) Loop 

This specific loop is call a ***For loop*** and can be iterated over any type of *collection/sequence*: list, tuple, range, string.    
In the last case it was over the values in a list. 


Block of code indented is executed for each value in the list (hence the name "for" loops, sometimes also called "for each" loops)
The loop ends after the variable has taken all the values in the collection.

In the diagram below you can see more obviously where the looping occurs as the green arrows make a clear loop.

Here is another example: 

```{python}
word = "Pandas"
for letter in word:
    print("Gimme a " + letter + "!")
print("What's that spell?!! " + word + "!")
```
Here we took each character in the string, concatenated it with other strings (we learned we can do that in the last Module) and printed an output in a loop.

## Looping in a dictionary

We can loop over the keys or values of a dictionary using `.keys()` and `.values()` respectively:

```{python}
cereals = {'Special K': 110, 'Lucky Charms': 150, 'Cheerios': 100, 'Wheaties': 120}

for key in cereals.keys():
  print(key)
```
```{python}
cereals = {'Special K': 110, 'Lucky Charms': 150, 'Cheerios': 100, 'Wheaties': 120}
calories = []

for val in cereals.values():
  calories.append(val)

calories
```

## range 

Instead of looping over items in a collection we can iterate over a sequence of numbers. `range()` is a verb that generates a sequence of integers up to some value.

```{python}
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```
We can also specify a start value, an end value and a skip-by value with range:

```{python}

for i in range(50,101,10):
    print(i)
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

The format is the starting integer first, the ending integer next and the skip by integer last. Remember that similarly to slicing with `.iloc[]` in pandas, the starting point of range is *inclusive* in the sequence and the ending number is *exclusive*.  

```python
range(start,end,skip)
```

The skip-by variable is optional though. In `range`, the default skip number is 1, so if we don't include it, Python will assume increasing in increments of 1. 

```{python}
for i in range(5,10):
    print(i)
```
If we only include a single integer in the function, a sequence up to the given number (not including it) will be generated starting from `0`.

```{python}
for i in range(4):
    print(i)
```

`range()` only works for integers. If we attempt a loop with type `float`, an error will occur: 

```{python, error=TRUE}
for i in range(0.5,1.0,0.1):
    print(i)
```

## Comprehensions

We learned in the last Module that we can make and `if`/`else` condition in a single line of code and we can do something similar with basic loops. 
**Comprehensions** allow us to build lists/tuples/sets/dictionaries in one convenient, compact line of code.

List comprehension can be done as so:
```{python}
sentence = ['This', 'checks', 'the', 'number', 'of', 'letter', 'per', 'word']

word_length = [len(word) for word in sentence]
word_length
```

to write the same thing without comprehension would look like this:

```{python}
word_length = []

for word in sentence:
  word_length.append(len(word))

word_length
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Dictionary comprehension can be done in a similar way but this time we wrap the line with curly brackets and specify what our keys and values are: 


```{python}
sentence = ['This', 'checks', 'the', 'number', 'of', 'letter', 'per', 'word']

word_length = {word : len(word) for word in sentence}
word_length
```

Both methods of building lists and dictionaries work and it's down to you to decide what works better for you.
