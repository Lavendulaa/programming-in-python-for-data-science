In the last section we learned about raising exceptions which in a lot
of cases helps the user identify if the they are using the code produced
correctly.

But how can we we so sure that the code we wrote is doing what we want
it to?

Does our code work 100% of the time?

These questions can be answered by using something called ***`assert`
statements***

## Assert Statements

Unlike exceptions which force an error when the condition specified is
`True`, `assert` statements cause your program to fail if the condition
is False. They can be used as sanity checks for your program.

``` python
assert 1 == 2 , "1 is not equal to 2."
```

```out
Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords): AssertionError: 1 is not equal to 2.

Detailed traceback: 
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
```
