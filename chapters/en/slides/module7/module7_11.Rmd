Notes: 

We've talked a lot about how to make sure our code works and that it does what we want it to, but just because it works, doesn't mean it's maintainable! 

Code has two “users” - the computer (which turns it into machine instructions) and humans, who will likely read and/or modify the code in the future.

This is why it's important to make your code suitable to that second audience, humans.

Writing readable and understandable code is important when sharing code to other users and reading back as your future self!

Remember: “Code is read much more often than it is written.”

### PEP8 

PEP8 is a style guide that recommends formatting such as:

- Indenting using 4 spaces
- Having whitespace around operators, e.g. x = 1 not x=1
- Avoiding extra whitespace such as f(1), not f (1)
- Single and double quotes for strings, but only using “””triple double quotes”””, not ‘’’triple single quotes’’’
- Variable and function names using underscores_between_words

### flake8

Notes: 

PEP8 is one of the many style guides used in programming. 

PEP8 recommends formatting such as:

- Indenting using 4 spaces
- Having whitespace around operators, e.g. x = 1 not x=1
- But avoiding extra whitespace such as f(1), not f (1)
- Single and double quotes both fine for strings, but only using “””triple double quotes”””, not ‘’’triple single quotes’’’
- Variable and function names use underscores_between_words

We can check our code to see if it complies with PEP8 formatting using a Python library called `flake8`. 

Think of it as a grammar check but for your code. 

`flake8` will tell us how and where our code is formatted poorly but it won't make any changes to it. That is up to us. 

We will show you shortly, how to use `flake8` in your Jupyter notebooks.

## Black

**Before `black`**
```{python}
def exponent_a_list(numerical_list   ,   exponent   =      2):

    if type(numerical_list         ) is    not list   :
                raise Exception(     "You are not using a list for the numerical_list input."   
                )

    new_exponent_list   = list()
    for   number in              numerical_list:
                new_exponent_list.append(                  number **  exponent  )
    return new_exponent_list
```

**After `black`**
```{python}
def exponent_a_list(numerical_list, exponent=2):

    if type(numerical_list) is not list:
        raise Exception("You are not using a list for the numerical_list input.")

    new_exponent_list = list()
    for number in numerical_list:
        new_exponent_list.append(number ** exponent)
    return new_exponent_list
```


Notes: 

Unlike PEP8 which is a style guide and flake8 which just tells you where your code needs changes, `black` is a tool that will format your code. 

Black will mostly follow the PEP8 style guide but with a few differences. 

When you use `black` with your code, you are wiping it of bad formatting like trailing whitespace and poor indentation. 

Let's see how we can use both of these in a Jupyter notebook.
