# Filtering

Filtering is probably one of the most frequent data manipulations you will do in data analysis.  Filtering is often used when we are either trying to rid the dataframe of unwanted rows or analyze rows with a particular column value. 

Think of it as a sieve keeping only the rows matching conditions you have set. 

Let's try to filter the `cereal.csv` dataset.


```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv')
df.head()
```

## Conditions

Suppose you are trying to find the information for cereals with a protein content greater than 4g per serving.
Our first instinct would be something along the line of 

```{python}
df['protein'] > 4
```

This can be translated as "From the `protein` column in the dataframe `df`, which have values greater than 4? 

The output shows all the index labels and a column with True or False values depending on if the row meets the condition.
Cereals with `True`  have a protein content greater than 4 and  `False` if they do not.  

But we want a dataframe will all the information that only contains the rows with protein above 4. How can that be achieved?

</audio></html>

---

We wrap in within our dataframe similarly to how we slice. 

```{python}
df[df['protein'] > 4]
```

Normally we use `df['column name':'column name']` to select certain rows by location, but now we are selecting based on if a condition results in "True" columns. 
    
The code can be translated to 
> Only select the rows from the dataframe `df` that from the `protein` column in the dataframe `df`, have values greater than 4"

We can see from the output that only the rows meeting the condition as displayed.

---

We can do this with equalities as well:

```{python}
df[df['protein'] == 4]
```

Now we get all the cereals with a protein content of 4g per serving.  The key point to remember here is that we use **2** equal signs.       
   
In Python, a single `=` is used as an assignment operator. We are setting objects equal to something. 
Double equal signs,  `==`,  is  used for comparison. We check if certain values are equivalent to one another.

We can filter categorical columns too.  In this example,  I only want cereals from the manufacturer "Q" (For Quaker):

```{python}
df[df['mfr'] == 'Q']
```

Here we are using the double equal signs we saw in the last slide.

##  Multiple Condition Filtering - "and"

We now know how to filter on one condition but how do we filter if we have many? 
Perhaps we only want cereals with protein content between 4 to 5 grams?
The cereals that meet protein contents greater or equal to 4 are the following:   

```{python}
df[df['protein'] >= 4]
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

And the cereals that meet the condition of protein content below or equal to 5 grams are the following:

```{python}
df[df['protein'] <= 5]

```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We add the 2 conditions together in code that looks like this:


```{python}
df[(df['protein'] >= 4) & (df['protein'] <= 5)]
```


Code Explained:     
We need to use the special symbol `&` indicating "and".  This means that both conditions must hold to be returned in the new dataframe. 
Each condition is wrapped with parentheses to distinguish the conditions from one another.

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />

---

That means that only rows present in **both** dataframes will be selected.

---

Next, we will look at a case where we filter on 2 different columns.  Let's say we only want cereals from the Quaker manufacturer, with a protein content greater than 4. 

```{python}
df[(df['mfr'] == 'Q') & (df['protein'] > 4)]
```

The same coding syntax can be applied to two different column conditions.

##  Multiple Condition Filtering - "or"

Suppose that we are interested in cereals that either are made from the Quaker manufacturer **OR** a protein content above 4.     
We only need one of these conditions to hold to return a row. 

```{python}
df[(df['mfr'] == 'Q') | (df['protein'] > 4)]
```

Instead of using the ` & ` symbol, we use ` | ` which is called the "pipe operator".  This means "or" in the Python programming language.

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

This time, filtering using "or" resulted in 10 cereals that met either of the conditions. When we filtered using "and",  only 1 cereal met both conditions.
