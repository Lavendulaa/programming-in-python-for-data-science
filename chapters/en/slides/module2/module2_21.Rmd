## What is Chaining?

Up until now, when we perform multiple actions on an object, we have been saving the results under a new object name. 
Chaining allows us to do multiple actions in a single line of code without the need to save each action in an intermediate object. 

You can imagine that we are linking verbs together similar to a chain.

When we made our frequency table in Module 1, we first saved the single column as an object before we used `value_counts()` like so:

```{python}
manufacturer_column = df['mfr']
manufacturer_column.value_counts()
```


Instead of saving the column in advance, we can skip this step and do this and the frequency table in one line with chaining:

```{python}
df['mfr'].value_counts()
```

The convenience doesn't stop there either.

Chaining is the design of performing each method sequentially. 
Let's say we want to perform 3 actions:     
  
1. Filter the dataframe for cereals only from manufacturer "K".       
2. Select the columns `calories`, `sugars` and `rating` using the verb `loc`.       
3. Find the mean of each column using `.mean()`.     

Normally our code would look like this:
```{python}
mfr_k = df[df['mfr'] == 'K']
csr_df = mfr_k.loc[:, ["calories", "sugars", "rating"]]
cereal_mean = csr_df.mean()
cereal_mean
```

---

Instead we can chain them:
```{python}
cereal_mean = df[df['mfr'] == 'K'].loc[:, ["calories", "sugars", "rating"]].mean()
cereal_mean
```

This chain avoided the use of 2 intermediate objects; `mfr_k` and `csr_df`.

We cut out creating intermediate variables which is great but now we have a really long line of code and it's a bit hard to read.

How can we make this easier to understand?     
In this course, we suggest giving a new line for each verb.  We can do this by wrapping our code in parentheses and making a new line before each period (` . `).  It's a good habit to indent and have the verbs lined up for additional clarity. 

```{python}
cereal_mean = (df[df['mfr'] == 'K'].loc[:, ["calories", "sugars", "rating"]]
                                   .describe()
                                   .head()
              )
```

## Coding Preferences

Although we have seen how chaining has advantages, it's a coding style that is adopted by the person writing the code. Some argue that it can add restrictions to your code. One thing that is for certain the readability of the code written. Someone else (or more often, future you!) must be able to understand what is being accomplished. 
This is why comments (`#`) are so important. If a lot is going on in your code, it's good habits to explain it whether it's with chaining, or without.
