# Reading Arguments

## Arguments 

When we load in our data we use different arguments to make sure it's organized how we want it. 

Remember how we load the majority of our data? 

```python
pd.read_csv('cereal.csv', index_col=0)
```

`index_col` is an argument that indicates which column will be acting as our index label.  In most of the cases we have encountered, it was the very first column.  

`delimiter` is another argument we have already discussed that instructs on how to separate each value in the data. 

This is only the tip of the iceburg.  There are many others that are helpful when reading in our data. 

Here, we are going to introduce a few more arguments to `pd.read_csv()` and `pd.read_excel()`: 

- `header`
- `nrows`
- `usecols`

If you wish to know more, you can find the documentation at the following links:

- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html" target="_blank">`pd.read_csv()`</a>
- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html" target="_blank">`pd.read_excel()`</a>

## header

We have been lucky up until now that all the data we have loaded in has been particularly straightforward.  Sometimes with data, there are a few lines of text explaining important points about the file.  We do not want to include this in our dataframe and therefore we need to specify exactly when our dataframe begins.  This is where `header` comes in. 
Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/MCL-DSCI-511-programming-in-python/blob/master/slides/candybars-h.csv" target="_blank">`candybars-h.csv` file </a> as an example.

If we look at the data with a regular text editor, the data doesn't start until line 3 which would be the equivalent of position 2 (since we begin at index 0).

"If we load this data without any arguments, this is the result:

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-h.csv')
candybars.head()
```

We see that there are no clear column names and things are in quite a disarray.

---

We use `header=2` to indicate where our dataframe begins. (2 being the index position or the row that contains the column labels)

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-h.csv', header=2)
candybars.head()
```

That's looking much better.

## nrows

`nrows` is useful when you only want to load in a slice of the dataframe.  Perhaps the file you have is large and you only want a sample of it.  `nrows` will limit the number of rows from the file to read in. 
Take our regular `candybar.csv` file, where we only want 7 of the rows of data. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', nrows=7)
candybars
```

## usecols

Similarly to how `nrows` specifies how many rows to read in, `usecols` selects which columns to load from the data.  Perhaps the only columns relevant to our analysis are the columns `name`, `weight` and `available_canada_america`.  We can forgo the other columns when reading the data in. 
In a similar way to selecting columns using `.iloc[]`, we put the desired column index positions in square brackets for the argument. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', usecols=[0, 1, 10])
candybars
```

The `usecols` argument accepts either index positions or labels so we could also use the column names in square brackets.

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', usecols=['name', 'weight', 'available_canada_america'])
candybars
```
