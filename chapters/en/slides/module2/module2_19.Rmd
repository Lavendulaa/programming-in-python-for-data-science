# Building on things we know

So far, we have accumulated many different skills to wrangle our data.  One type of transformation that you may use often is replacing values within a column depending on a certain condition.  Let's bring in a smaller version of our cereal dataset.

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv',
                  index_col=0, 
                  usecols=['name', 'mfr', 'type', 'calories', 'protein', 'weight', 'rating'])
df.head()
```

In the dataframe, the manufacturer value "Q" isn't that informative and it might be easier to understand our data if we change all these values to something more complete like "Quaker".

This leads to to our task:    
***Replace the "Q" manufacturer values, with a new value of "Quaker"***

---

Our first instinct may be to first filter those rows using the technique we learned in our last section.  From our new filtered selection, perhaps we could assign values of "Quaker"  to column `mfr` using similar code to below: 

```{python}
df[df['mfr'] == 'Q'].assign(mfr = 'Quaker')
```


That looks like it did what we want but what happened to the rest of our dataframe? 
Remember that we only want to replace the values in our existing dataframe and not create a new one. 

When we use the `.assign()` verb, it creates a new dataframe instead of altering the current one.  This is problematic since we still want the original dataframe but with certain values updated. So what do we do?

# Building on more things we know

Remember our friend `.loc[]`?  We are going to get reacquainted with it.  Similarly, to how `.loc[]` can select and return specified columns and rows of the dataframe, it can filter on conditions too.    
We are used to seeing code involving `.loc[]` like this:

```{python}
df.loc['Trix'] 
```

But we get introduced to a new side of it when we use it to filter as well. 

```{python}
df.loc[df['mfr'] == 'Q']
```

We can use the same syntax (`df['mfr'] == 'Q'`) we normally would when filtering, however this time, we wrap the whole thing within `.loc[]`

Some people may be asking, "Why don't we do all our filtering like this then?" Well, the answer is, you can, but we prefer not to.  Filtering without `.loc[]` is a bit more readable and more efficient when doing analysis. 

Let's concentrate back on our task of only replacing `mfr` values equal to "Q" to "Quaker".  How can `.loc[]` help us with this? 

Unlike with filtering, `.loc[]` accepts more arguments within it.  We have the ability to specify not only the target rows matching a specific condition but our column of interest as well.

```{python}
df.loc[df['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr']
```

Once we have that, we can then assign these rows the new values 'Quaker' in the `mfr` column. 
```{python}
df.loc[df['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] = 'Quaker'
```

Wait!  Nothing was outputted!  What happened?

Let's take a look at the original dataframe

```{python}
df.head(14)
```

We can now see that the `Q` manufacturer values have changed to `Quaker`. 

When we use this syntax, we do not need to save the results in a new object name like we had to with `.assign()` and `.drop()`. 

Let's discuss what really is happening behind the scenes.

Remember what the condition  `df['mfr'] == 'Q'` returns?

It produces a dataframe containing all the rows with True/False values depending on if the row meets the condition. 
```{python}
df['mfr'] == 'Q'
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Essentially our code is finding the rows with `True` values and replacing the values in the `mfr` column (like we specified) the new value of 'Quaker'.

---

You can split up how this code works into 3 steps: 

1. We use `.loc[]` to find the rows specifying certain conditions:   

```python
df.loc[df['mfr'] == 'Q']
```

2. We next indicate which column we wish to replace with the new values:

```python
df.loc[df['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] 
```

3. Once we have obtained our desired rows and the column which we are editing, we assign a value to the row meeting the condition (a "True" value):

```python
df.loc[df['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] = 'Quaker'
```

Does this work without using `.loc[]`?  Let's give it a try. 

```python
df[df['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] = 'Quaker'
```

```out
TypeError: 'Series' objects are mutable, thus they cannot be hashed
```

Unfortunately, we are not able to replace values in this manner and it results in an error since filtering this way does not allow us to specify columns like this.

# Replacing with Inequalities. 

This syntax also works for inequality conditions.

If we are replacing numerical values with characters or words (or vice versa) we need to assign our desired values to a **new column** and not the existing one.    
Perhaps we want just 2 categories for protein levels - "high" and "low".  Any cereal above 3 grams of protein will be considered a "high" protein level and anything less, as a "low" protein level. 

Let's assign the "high" protein values first.  The only difference here from earlier is we now use an inequality for our condition and we designate a new column name instead of an existing one.  Let's save the values in a column named `protein_level`.


```{python}
df.loc[df['protein'] >= 3, 'protein_level']  = 'high' 
```

Next by the "low" values.

```{python}
df.loc[df['protein'] < 3, 'protein_level']  = 'low' 
```

Let's take a look at the dataframe now: 

```{python}
df.head(10)
```

## Creating new columns 

You may have noticed we did not use `.assign()` to create our new column.  That's because as we mentioned earlier, when we use `.assign()` it creates a brand new dataframe.  When we are replacing values, we don't want a new dataframe and instead, we just want to alter the current values in the existing dataframe.

When we are not doing conditional value replacement, we could create new columns with a similar syntax.  Take the example of converting the weight from ounces into grams and making a new column named `weight_g`. 

```{python}
oz_to_g = 28.3495
df['weight_g'] = df['weight']*oz_to_g
df.head()
```


This syntax is editing the existing dataframe `df` instead of creating a new one.  We prefer `.assign()` where possible since it provides more flexibility.  It gives us an opportunity to name the new dataframe something different and keep our original dataframe untransformed.  This prevents the need to re-read in our data to get our original dataframe back (which could take a long time if the dataset is large).
