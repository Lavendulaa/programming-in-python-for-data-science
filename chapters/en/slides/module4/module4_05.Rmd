## Sequences 

In the last section we discussed the `str` data type. 
We described it as  _a sequence of characters_. In many cases, there is good reason to split up a long text strings into separate ones. 
luckily we have a convenient verb to do that `.split()`. 

```{python}
sentence = "I always lose at least one sock when I do laundry." 
words = sentence.split()
words
```
This verb then splits up the string into separate words.     
We can change where to split the string as well. 

```{python}
sentence.split("e")
```
This argument uses the character "e" to separate string are and discards of the separators. 

Why is it returned in square brackets though?

## Lists 

The output from the `.split()` verb is called a **list**. 
Similarly to how a string is a sequence of characters that depend on an order, a list is a sequence of elements with a particular order. lists can be identify by their square brackets.

```{python}
words
```

```{python}
type(words)
```

The elements in a list can be a combination of any of the data types.

```{python}
my_list = [1.2, 3, None, True, 'One of the lost socks']
my_list
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

They can even have elements that are lists 

```{python}
lists_of_lists = [[1,2], ['buckle', 'My', 'Shoe'], 3, 4]
lists_of_lists
```

We can get the length of a list, with `len()` like we did for strings. 

```{python}
len(lists_of_lists)
```

Notes: Script here

<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Similarly to how we can slice dataframes by columns and rows, we can slice lists by elements

```{python}
lists_of_lists[1]
```

```{python}
lists_of_lists[1:3]
```

Note that slicing lists works similarly to slicing with `iloc[]`; the start is inclusive and the end is exclusive.
So `lists_of_lists[1:3]` fetches elements 1 and 2, but not 3.
In other words, it gets the 2nd and 3rd elements in the list.

## Mutable vs Immutable 


A data structure is **mutable**  if it can be modified. 

Lists are mutable and we can assign new values for its various entries.

For example: 
```{python}
my_list
```

I can edit any entry in this list and replace it with a new value.

```{python}
my_list[3] = "Ta Da!"
```


```{python}
my_list
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We can also replace entries in a **nested** list (list within a list). 


```{python}
lists_of_lists
```


```{python}
lists_of_lists[1][2] = "Sandal"
lists_of_lists
```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Strings can be sliced just like list...

```{python}
sentence
```


```{python}
sentence[27:35]
```

 But we cannot replace characters. 
 
```{python error=TRUE}
sentence[5] = "Z"
```
 
That means values of type `str`, are **immutable**.

# List Verbs 

Unlike strings once again, list have <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" target="_blank">A variety of different methods</a> for interacting with its data. Here are just a few. 

```{python}
primes = [2,3,5,7,11]
```

We can add to the end of a list with `append()`:

```{python}
primes.append(13)
primes
```

We can find the maximum value in the list with `max()`:

```{python}
max(primes)
```

and the sum of the list with `sum()`:
```{python}
sum(primes)
```

## Lists to Dataframes 

Up until this point we have been working with dataframes that have been read in and converted from different types of files. We, however can make dataframes from scratch using lists. 

Let's say I wanted a dataframe of things I needed to purchase from the store on my next grocery shopping trip. 

```{python}
item1 = ['toothpaste', 'London Drugs', 3.99]
item2 = ['apples', 'Produce Store', 4.00]
item3 = ['bread', 'Bakery', 3.50]

column_names = ['item', 'location', 'price']

shopping_items = pd.DataFrame(data = [item1, item2, item3], columns=column_names)
shopping_items
```

We use a list for each row and a list for the column labels. We then use a list of all the rows to make up the data.

## Tuples 

Tuples are a data structure very similar to lists but with the 2 main differences: 

1. They can be contained in parenthesis, and
2. They are immutable

```{python}
my_tuple = ('I', 'lose', None,  'socks', 'when', 1, 'do', 'laundry.', False)
my_tuple
```

```{python}
type(my_tuple)
```



```{python error=TRUE}
my_tuple[2] = 'Many'
```
