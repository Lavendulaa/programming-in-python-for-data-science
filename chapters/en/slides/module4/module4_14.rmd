## What is a Dataframe ... again

Since the begining of this module,  we have explored basic Python Data types and structures. We've covered how they can be transformed into a dataframe but that didn't answer the lingering question ***"What is and makes up a Pandas dataframe?"***

Let's greet our cereal data back with a warm welcome. 

```{python}
cereal
```

On first instinct is to see what `type()` returns. 

```{python}
type(cereal)
```

It appears that dataframes have their own data type called a `pandas.core.frame.DataFrame` or let's just call it a `pd.DataFrame` type for short. 

Looking into this further the documentation states a dataframe as a: 

_" Two-dimensional tabular data structure with columns and axis labels."_ 

More directly, we can describe a dataframe as a collection of columns but that brings us to the new question:    
    
**"What is a dataframe column?"**

Let's think back to Module 1 when we were selecting a single column from a dataframe.  
There are two ways of doing so; with single brackets, and with double brackets.  What is the difference? 

```{python}
cereal[['mfr']]
```
```{python}
type(cereal[['mfr']])
```

That's no surprise, what about single brackets?

```{python}
cereal['mfr']
```


```{python}
type(cereal['mfr'])
```

## Pandas Series

A pandas Series is a one dimension array of values with an axis label. This is the base datatype that make up a pandas dataframe. In fact the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/dsintro.html#dataframe" target="_blank"Pandas documentation"</a> explain it as "a dict of Series objects". 
 
let's look back at the series output again: 

```{python}
cereal['mfr']
```
We can see additional information at the bottom. The axis labeled `mfr`, the length equal to 77 and the `dtype`: object.

## What is a dtype? 

So far we know a dataframe is made up of a collection of series and a series contains values, a label as well has some additional information regarding a `dtype`. 

Just like how values have the data types ( `str`, `int`, `float`, etc.), Pandas columns have dtype.
