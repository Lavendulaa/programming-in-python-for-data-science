## What is a Dataframe ... again

Since the beginning of this module,  we have explored basic Python Data types and structures. We've covered how they can be transformed into a dataframe but that didn't answer the lingering question ***"What is and makes up a Pandas dataframe?"***

Let's greet our cereal data back with a warm welcome. 

```{python}
cereal
```

</audio></html>

On first instinct is to see what `type()` returns. 

```{python}
type(cereal)
```

It appears that dataframes have their own data type called a `pandas.core.frame.DataFrame` or let's just call it a `pd.DataFrame` type for short. 

Looking into this further the documentation states a dataframe as a: 

_" Two-dimensional tabular data structure with columns and axis labels."_ 

More directly, we can describe a dataframe as a collection of columns but that brings us to the new question:    
    
**"What is a dataframe column?"**

Let's think back to Module 1 when we were selecting a single column from a dataframe.  
There are two ways of doing so; with single brackets, and with double brackets.  What is the difference? 

```{python}
cereal[['mfr']]
```

```{python}
type(cereal[['mfr']])
```

That's no surprise, what about single brackets?

```{python}
cereal['mfr']
```


```{python}
type(cereal['mfr'])
```

## Pandas Series

A pandas Series is a one-dimensional array of values with an axis label. This is the base data type that makes up a pandas dataframe. In fact, the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/dsintro.html#dataframe" target="_blank"Pandas documentation"</a> explain it as "a dict of Series objects". 
 
let's look back at the series output again: 

```{python}
cereal['mfr']
```
We can see additional information at the bottom. The axis labelled `mfr`, the length equal to 77 and the `dtype`: object.

## What is a dtype? 

So far we know a dataframe is made up of a collection of series and a series contains values, a label as well as some additional information regarding a **dtype**. 

Just like how values have the data types ( `str`, `int`, `float`, etc.), Columns in a Pandas dataframe have types called **dtypes**. 

In this course we are going to concentrate on the following dtypes but there others:

Just like with Python data types, Pandas has numeric and non-numeric data types. 

#### Numeric dtypes

- `float64` dtype is a column that contains only `float` type values in the cells of the dataframe, whereas, 
- `int64` columns only contains values of type `int` in the cells. 

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We can use the noun `.dtypes` to find the dtype of a column:

```{python}
cereal.head()
```
Let's see the `calories` column dtype:
```{python}
cereal['calories'].dtypes
```

What is the data type of one of the values in the the column? 
```{python}
all_bran_fiber =  cereal.loc[2, 'calories']
type(all_bran_fiber)
```

We are going to ignore the `numpy` portion for now but we clearly see it says `int`.

---


```{python}
cereal.head()
```

Let's check out the `fiber` column dtype now:
```{python}
cereal['fiber'].dtypes
```

Ah yes float64. What about the data type of one of the values in the the column now? 
```{python}
all_bran_fiber =  cereal.loc[2, 'fiber']
type(all_bran_fiber)
```

 of type `float`! (Again, let's not worry about the numpy portion of this)

## Non-Numeric dtypes 

<center><img src='/module4/full.png' width="80%"></center>

These can be a bit more complicated but let's concentrate on the dtypes `object` and `bool`. We will be exploring `datetime64` in Module 7. 


- `object`  is a dtype that contains `str` type values in the cells of the dataframe or that had a mixture of different types to begin with. This is the "default" dtype when pandas is not quite sure what is the cell type values are or when there is a mixture of numeric and non-numeric value types. 

- `bool` dtypes, just like it's dtype name, contains `bool` type values. 


Notes: Script here

---

```{python}
cereal.head()
```

Let's take a look at the `name` column:

```{python}
cereal['name'].dtypes
```

Here, "O" stands for object. What about a value within the column series:

```{python}
type(cereal.loc[2, 'name'])
```

The "All-Bran" is a  `str` value type that resides in a column of dtype `object`.  



Notes: Script here

<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---


```{python}
cereal.head()
```

What about the `hot` column:

```{python}
cereal['hot'].dtypes
```

And the column value within the series:

```{python}
type(cereal.loc[2, 'hot'])
```

Also a `bool`. We can ignore the numpy part as we did before, we will discuss this later.

</audio></html>

---

An easy way to  check all dtypes of the columns in our dataframe is to use `.dtypes` on the dataframe object. 

```{python}
cereal.dtypes
```
Knowing what dtype the values are, helps us understand how we can transform them and how they respond to different operations and operators.
