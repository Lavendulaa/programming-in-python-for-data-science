# Python operations

We have already been a witness to a few of Python's arithmetic operators, but there are a few on this list that you have to to see:   
  
| Operator | Description |  
| :---:|:---:|  
| `+` | addition |  
| `-` | subtraction |  
| `*` | multiplication |  
| `/` | division |  
| `**` | exponentiation |

Let's apply these to the Python types we have learned and observe the results.

## Numeric Operations 

These operators act as expected on numeric types: 

And `int` plus a `float` results in a `float`: 

```{python}
6 + 5.7
```

And the subtraction of 2 values of type `int` results with a type `int`:
```{python}
15 - 7
```


Exponents can be calculated with `**` with `int` values:
```{python}
2 ** 3
```

And `float` datatypes:

```{python}
2.2 ** 5
```

## Bool 

These operations work as expected with numeric values but let's put on concentration on what happens with the other data types and structures. 
What happens when we try to add up `bool` values? 

```{python}
True + True 
```

```{python}
True * 4
```

We see that `True` values as cast as a value of `1` and False as a value of `0` when they undergo operations: 
```{python}
False * 2 + True
```

```{python}
False + 4
```

## Str

Strings react rather interestingly with the addition operator.  
For instance, when we add strings we add the sequence from one end to the other: 

```{python}
'The monster under my bed' + ' is named Mike' 
```

But we cannot multiply, divide or subtract them. 

```{python error=TRUE}
'The monster under my bed' - ' is named Mike' 
```
```{python error=TRUE}
'The monster under my bed' / ' is named Mike' 
```

---

We saw that we can operate on `float` and `int` values together but what about `str` and numeric values? 

```{python error=TRUE}
'The monster under my bed' + 1200
```
That does not work, however, if we transform cast the numeric to a string, we can concatenate the two together: 

```{python}
'The monster under my bed' + str(1200)
```

How about with other data structure like **lists**, **tuples** and **dictionaries**?

What about multiplication? 

```{python}
'The monster under my bed' * 3
```

We can multiply strings and it concatenates the strings together! Since we multiplied by 3, the string is repeated 3 times.

## List 

If we add lists, similarly to strings, the elements are combine to create a single list containing the elements of both lists. 
```{python}
list1 = [1, 2.0, 3, 4.5] + ['nine', 'ten', 'eleven', 'twelve']
```
We can add, but other operators are not supported. 
```{python error=TRUE}
[1, 2.0, 3, 4.5] * [5, 6, 7, 8]
```

## Boolean Operators 

When we've filtered our data we've seen different boolean operators however we have yet to see all that is available.

|Operator    |Description|
|:------:|:--------------|
|`x == y`|    is x equal to y?|
|`x != y`|    is x not equal to y?|
|`x > y` |    is x greater than y?|
|`x >= y`|    is x greater than or equal to y?|
|`x < y` |    is x less than y?|
|`x <= y`|    is x less than or equal to y?|
|`x is y`|    is x the same object as y?|
|`x and y` |     are x and y both true? |
|`x or y`    | is at least one of x and y true?|
|`not x`    | is x false?|

Let's explores these a bit more.

Let's start with 2 base statements: 
```{python}
'dogs' != 'cats'
```

```{python}
6 > 7
```

We can combine them to explore `and`, `or` and `not` operators. 
```{python}
(6 < 7) and ('dogs' == 'cats')
```
Since both statements are not true, the "and" statement is False.


```{python}
(6 < 7) or ('dogs' == 'cats')
```
Since one statement is true the combine "or" statement is True.

---

We know that `('dogs' == 'cats') ` is False so a `not` operator gives us a True value because it confirms the fact the statement is False. 
```{python}
not ('dogs' == 'cats')
```

While we know `(6 < 7)` is True:
```{python}
not  (6 < 7)
```
Seeing if the statement is False will result in a False statement since `(6 < 7)` is True.

How can we translate this to dataframes? Have you ever wondered why we can do summary statistics on some columns and not others? We are going to explore this in the next section.
