# Working with Dates and Time

It wasn't too long ago in Module 4 where we briefly mention another column dtype called `datetime64`. 

<center><img src='/module4/full.png' width="100%"></center>


Dates and times can we a bit tricky and require a specific data type so that analysis can be done correctly.

Parse data yourself can be difficult and time consuming. 
Let's make a quick attempt at converting the `bite_date` column which is currently of dtype `object` into separate numeric columns so we can sort them in a temporal manner. 

```{python}
bites.head()
```
First we would need to split them up and rename the columns:

```{python}
dates = (bites['bite_date'].str.split('-', expand=True)
                           .rename(columns = {0:'Year',
                                              1:'Month',
                                              2:'Day'}))
dates.head()
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Currently the values in `dates` are of type `str` so we would not be able to sort them in a temporal manner:

```{python}
dates.iloc[0,0]
type(dates.iloc[0,0])
```

We need to convert all the values to integers and add them to the previous dataframe `bites`. 

```{python}
bites_dates = (bites.assign(Year = dates['Year'].astype(int),
                            Month = dates['Month'].astype(int),
                            Day = dates['Day'].astype(int)))
bites_dates.head()
```
Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

And now, can we sort them:

```{python}
bites_dates.sort_values(['Year', 'Month', 'Day']).head()
```


After doing all this, there are still a lot of limitations. 

Luckily, Pandas has some built in functions we can use that will make our lives much easier.

## Pandas parse_dates

Remember How Pandas is built using the `NumPy` library? Well in a similar way, Pandas datetime verbs are build from the built-in Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html" target="_blank">`Datetime` library</a>. 

We can parse our data at the same time as we read in our dataframe using the argument `parse_date`. 
Let's do it by reading in our `animal_bites2.csv` file:

```{python}
bites = pd.read_csv('animalbites.csv', parse_dates = ['bite_date'])
bites.head()
```
Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python echo=FALSE}
bites.head()
```


It looks like the same dataframe but now if we check the dtype of `bite_date`, you'll see it adopts a `datetime64` dtype. 

```{python }
bites.dtypes
```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Maybe our date is split between multiple columns and we want a single datetime column.
Take `bites_split.csv` for example: 

```{python}
pd.read_csv('bites_split.csv').head()
```
We can convert this to a single column by using a dictionary within the `parse_dates` column. The dictionary key, indicates the column name and the dictionary value is a list containing multiple columns to use as the new date column :

```{python}
pd.read_csv('bites_split.csv', parse_dates={'bite_date': ['bite_year', 'bite_month', 'bite_day']}).head()
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

What if we need to convert the column after reading in our data? That's not a problem! We have `pd.to_datetime()` to convert columns of an already existing dataframe. 

Let's use our original `bites` dataframe where `bite_date` is still of dtype `object`.
```{python}
bites = pd.read_csv('animalbites.csv')
bites.head()
```
```{python}
bites.dtypes
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

If we want to convert `bite_date` to a datetime dtype, we can do so pairing `pd.to_datetime()` with `assign()`

```{python}
new_bites = bites.assign(bite_date = pd.to_datetime(bites['bite_date']))
new_bites.head()
```

```{python}
new_bites.dtypes
```
Ok but what if I don't want the full datetime value and I want a column with only a portion of it, like the month, or year?

we can a new column to our dataframe in a similar as we did before but instead this time we obtain a function to select only a portion of the datetime value. There are a <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#time-date-components" target="_blank">number of different functions</a> that selects a specific part datatime value: 

- `.dt.day_name()` for the day of the week 

```{python}
new_bites.assign(weekday = new_bites['bite_date'].dt.day_name()).head()
```
- `dt.month` for the month 

```{python}
new_bites.assign(month = new_bites['bite_date'].dt.month).head()
```

---

There is some inconsistency of when to use `()` in our datetime actions but here are some of the most common: 

- `dt.month`
- `dt.month_name()`
- `dt.day`
- `dt.day_name()`
- `dt.hour`
- `dt.minute`

Using the `.dt` can only be used on a pandas Series. We can extract the day, month, year hour, or minute from a single datetime value, using similar nouns without the `dt.`.

First let's see how that's possible. 

If I select the first example in row 1, you'll notice that it outputs something called a `Timestamp`. 

```{python}
timestamp_ex = new_bites.loc[1,'bite_date']
timestamp_ex
```
This is a pandas datatype. 


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python}
timestamp_ex
```
Timestamps shows a complete time snapshot. Timestamps must be complete with both dates and time and if none was provided, Python will fill in the unknown with default values, in this case `00:00:00`. 

To obtain the  month_name, day, or hour from the Timestamp, we can use the same nouns in the previous slide without `.ts.`:

```{python}
timestamp_ex.month_name()
```
```{python}
timestamp_ex.day
```

```{python}
timestamp_ex.hour
```

---

In our analysis it might be important to know how frequent events occur and the time between them. `.diff()` is a useful function for that. 

```{python}
bite_intervals = new_bites['bite_date'].sort_values().diff()
bite_intervals
```
This outputs a pandas Series with the time that occurs between rows. 

You'll now notice a new dtype at the bottom of our new pandas Series  <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html" target="_blank">`timedelta64`</a>.

## timedelta

Unlike a `Timestamp` that represents a snapshot in time, `timedelta` represents a duration of time. 

This means that it is a measurement of time that can be extracted from the object as a particular unit of time. 
Here we can obtain the number of days between 2 bite cases. 

```{python}
bite_intervals[1]
```
```{python}
bite_intervals[1].days
```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We can find the maximum amount of time between cases:

```{python}
bite_intervals.max()
```
and the minimum time between cases:

```{python}
bite_intervals.min()
```
And do simple operation with them:

```{python}
interval_range = bite_intervals.max() - bite_intervals.min()
interval_range
```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We could even obtain the total days of the operation:

```{python}
interval_range.days
```
and convert it into years 

```{python}
interval_range.days/365.25
```
