## Creating 2D Arrays

We saw in the last set of slides that we can create 1D arrays using a number of different functions such as `np.array()`:
```{python}
my_array = np.array((1, 2, 3, 4))
my_array
```

We can also use the same functions to make multi-dimensional arrays which are indicated by double square brackets `[[ ]]`:

```{python}
list_2d = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
array_2d = np.array(list_2d)
array_2d
```

Some of the functions that we use to create arrays have the ability for us to specify them with multi-dimensions:
```{python}
np.zeros((3,4))
```

```{python}
np.random.rand(4, 2) 
```

and if not, can use the verb `.reshape()` to tranform a 1D array into a multi-dimension array: 

```{python}
np.arange(0,12).reshape(3,4)
```

## Array Shapes 

We saw how to make multi-dimensional arrays but dimension is quite different than what the shape of an array is?  

<center><img src='/module8/arrays2.png' width="80%"></center>

Here are three main array nouns we need to know to understand the characteristics of an array:

- `.ndim`: the number of dimensions of an array

- `.shape`: the number of elements in each dimension (like calling `len()` on each dimension)

- `.size`: the total number of elements in an array (i.e., the product of `.shape`)

`array1` is an example of a 1d array:

```{python}
array1 = np.ones(4)
array1
```
We can use `.ndim` to check the number of dimensions and just as we suspected it is 1: 
```{python}
array1.ndim
```
We use `.shape` to find the number of elements in each dimension:

```{python}
array1.shape
```
This returns a tuple with only 1 value which represents the 1 dimension.

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python}
array1
```

Finally, `.size` will return the ***total*** number of values in the array. 

```{python}
array1.size
```

Let's try this again with a 2d array. 

```{python}
array_2d = np.ones((3, 2))
array_2d
```
The number of square brackets in an array depicts how many dimensions an array consists of.

We can confirm the number of dimensions with `ndim`:
```{python}
array_2d.ndim
```
The shape of the array now consists of two elements, one for each dimension: 
```{python}
array_2d.shape
```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python}
array_2d.shape
```

And the size is the product of the values in `.shape`:
```{python}
array_2d.size
```

If we have the `.shape()` of the array, we can get both the `.ndim` of the array:

```{python}
len(array_2d.shape)
```
as well as the size:

```{python}
np.prod(array_2d.shape)
```

## Indexing and Slicing 2D arrays 


Slicing 2D arrays can be compared to slicing pandas dataframes (without the `.iloc[]`). 

```{python}
arr2 = np.arange(0,12).reshape(3,4)
arr2
```

Let's say we want to select `6`. It's located in row 1 and column 2 (remember that the index includes 0). 

```{python}
arr2[1, 2]
```
We could also do the same thing using this notation, but it's not recommended. 

```{python}
arr2[1][2]
```

Notes: Script here

<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python echo=FALSE}
arr2
```

If we want a complete row of the array, we can specify with a single number:

```{python}
arr2[2]
```
And if we only want a single column we can use the same syntax we used with `.iloc[]`:

```{python}
arr2[:,2]
```
We can obtain specific slices by using a colon as well. If we only wanted the first 2 rows and the last 3 columns, we could do the following:
```{python}
arr2[:2,1:]
```

</audio></html>

---

We can take the <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose" target="_blank">***transpose***</a> of the array by using `.T`:
```{python}
arr2.T
```
This converts the columns to rows and the columns to rows. 

We can replace values in an array with the assignment operator: 

```{python}

arr2[1,1] = 77777
arr2
```
