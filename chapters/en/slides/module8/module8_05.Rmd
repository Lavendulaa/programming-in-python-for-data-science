## Creating Arrays

We saw in the last set of slides that we can create arrays using `np.array()`:
```{python}
my_array = np.array((1, 2, 3, 4))
my_array
```
We can also make them from lists instead of tuples too:

```{python}
my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
my_array
```

We can also have multi-dimensional arrays which are indicated by double square brackets `[[ ]]`:

```{python}
list_2d = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
array_2d = np.array(list_2d)
array_2d
```

---

There are also several built-in NumPy functions that create different arrays with patterns and requirements: 

`np.zeros()` will create an array containing `0` for each element and the input argument specifies the size:
```{python}
np.zeros(10)
```
Similarly, `np.ones()` does the same thing except with an array of elements with `1` values:

```{python}
np.ones(4)
```
`np.arange()` similarly to `range()` can take 1, 2 or 3 input arguments and will produce an array in a similar way that `range()` produces a sequence. 

```{python}
np.arange(5)
```
```{python}
np.arange(0, 10, 2) 
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

`np.linspace()` will produce an array containing the number of elements specified by the 3rd argument's value, containing values between the first 2 arguments values. 
Example: 20, equally spaced values from 1 to 5:
```{python}
np.linspace(1,5,20)
```
The elements in `np.linspace()` arrays are defaulted to type `float`.    
We can also produce an array with random values using `np.random.rand()`.          
Example: Random numbers uniformly distributed from 0 to 1
```{python}
np.random.rand(5) 
```
We can also specify the number of dimensions for it: 
```{python}
np.random.rand(4, 2) 
```

## Elementwise operations 

As we saw in Exercise 4, that arrays operate in an elementwise manner. 

When we do many operations, the operation is done to each element in the array. 

```{python}
array1 = np.ones(4)
array1
```
```{python}
array2 = array1 + 1
array2
```

```{python}
array1 - array2
```
```{python}
array1 * array2
```

## Array Shapes 

<center><img src='/module8/arrays2.png' width="80%"></center>

As we just saw above, arrays can be of any dimension, shape and size.

In fact, there are three main array nouns we need to know to understand the characteristics of an array:

- `.ndim`: the number of dimensions of an array

- `.shape`: the number of elements in each dimension (like calling `len()` on each dimension)

- `.size`: the total number of elements in an array (i.e., the product of `.shape`)

`array1` is an example of a 1d array:

```{python}
array1
```
We can use `.ndim` to check the number of dimensions and just as we suspected it is 1: 
```{python}
array1.ndim
```
We use `.shape` to find the number of elements in each dimension:

```{python}
array1.shape
```
This returns a tuple with only 1 value which represents the 1 dimension. 
Finally, `.size` will return the ***total*** number of values in the array. 

```{python}
array1.size
```

---

Let's try this again with a 2d array. 

```{python}
array_2d = np.ones((3, 2))
array_2d
```
The number of square brackets in an array depicts how many dimensions an array consists of.

We can confirm the number of dimensions with `ndim`:
```{python}
array_2d.ndim
```
The shape of the array now consists of two elements, one for each dimension: 
```{python}
array_2d.shape
```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python}
array_2d.shape
```

And the size is the product of the values in `.shape`:
```{python}
array_2d.size
```

If we have the `.shape()` of the array, we can get both the `.ndim` of the array:

```{python}
len(array_2d.shape)
```
as well as the size:

```{python}
np.prod(array_2d.shape)
```

## Indexing and Slicing

1D arrays are sliced in the same manner that lists are.
```{python}
arr = np.arange(10)
arr
```

```{python}
arr[7]
```
The first value is included and the last value is excluded:
```{python}
arr[2:6]
```
To obtain elements from right to left, we use negative integers:
```{python}
arr[-1]
```

Notes: Script here

<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Slicing 2D arrays can be compared to slicing pandas dataframes (without the `.iloc[]`). 

```{python}
arr2 = np.arange(0,12).reshape(3,4)
arr2
```
In the code above, `.reshape` simply reshapes the original 1D array to a 2D array with a 3 x 4 shape. 

Let's say we want to select `6`. It's located in row 1 and column 2 (remember that the index includes 0). 

```{python}
arr2[1, 2]
```
We could also do the same thing using this notation but, it's not recommended. 

```{python}
arr2[1][2]
```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python echo=FALSE}
arr2
```

If we want a complete row of the array, we can specify with a single number:

```{python}
arr2[2]
```
And if we only want a single column we can use the same syntax we used with `.iloc[]`:

```{python}
arr2[:,2]
```
We can obtain specific slices by using a colon as well. If we only wanted the first 2 rows and the last 3 columns, we could do the following:
```{python}
arr2[:2,1:]
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We can take the <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose" target="_blank">***transpose***</a> of the array by using `.T`:
```{python}
arr2.T
```
This converts the columns to rows and the columns to rows. 

We can replace values in an array with the assignment operator: 

```{python}

arr2[1,1] = 77777
arr2
```

## Boolean Indexing 

Let's take a 1D array that consists of 10 decimal elements. 
```{python}
decimal_array = np.random.rand(10)
decimal_array
```
Remember that when we do most operations, it occurs in an element-wise manner:
```{python}
decimal_array + 1
```
Let's assign a threshold and find all the elements in `decimal_array`  greater than 0.5. We can name this new array that is made of Boolean values `threshold`:

```{python}
threshold = decimal_array > 0.5
threshold

```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We now can replace all those values that have a `True` Boolean,  a new value, in this case let's assign them a value of 0.5:

```{python}
decimal_array[threshold] = 0.5 
decimal_array
```

We could also shorten the whole process and avoided making `threshold` by using the following code:
```{python}
new_decimal_array = np.random.rand(4)
new_decimal_array
```
```{python}
new_decimal_array[new_decimal_array>0.5] = 0.5
new_decimal_array
```
