Although we have not formally introduced you to NumPy, The name may sound familiar since we've been subtly hinting at its existence for a little while now. In the last Module, we've had you import this library for practice. 

```{python}
import numpy as np
```


So what is NumPy?

## What is Numpy 

The name NumPy is derived from **"Numerical Python extensions"**.

NumPy is a Python library used primarily for numerical computing. It is especially useful as it provides a multidimensional array object, called an ***array***.

In addition, NumPy also offers numerous other mathematical functions used in the domain of linear algebra and Calculus.

## So What is an Array? 

A numpy array is somewhat like a list:

```{python}
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list
```

```{python}
my_array = np.array((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
my_array
```

And arrays are considered their own data type:

```{python}
type(my_array)
```

</audio></html>

However, we'll start to see that although lists and arrays appear quite similar, they have some key differences. 
A list can contain multiple data types: 

```{python}
my_list = [1,"hi"]
```

An array cannot: 
```{python}
my_array = np.array((1, "hi"))
my_array
```
In this case, `1` was converted to `'1'` which is now a string.

Additionally, arrays are described as n-dimensional data structures - meaning they can be any positive integer dimension.

## Why NumPy?

- Lists are often used with a similar purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
- Because of this, NumPy is used to create many other structures. 
- In fact, let's refresh ourselves on certain values in a dataframe:


```{python}
cereal.head()
```
Remember when we obtained the data type of a specific value in a dataframe? 
```{python}
type(cereal.loc[3,'calories'])
```
We obtained this `<class 'numpy.int64'>` which we originally ignored. It's outputting a `numpy.int64` data type because pandas dataframes are all built from NumPy arrays!

## NumPy Functions

NumPy also offers an assortment of handy mathematical constants and functions.

```{python}
np.pi
```
<img src='/module8/inf.gif'  alt="404 image"/>
```{python}
np.inf
```
<img src='/module8/e.gif'  alt="404 image"/>
```{python}
np.e
```

`np.prod()` calculates the product of values in an array:
```{python}
np.prod([2, 3, 1])
```

And `np.diff()` calculates the difference between element (left element subtracted from the right element):
```{python}
np.diff([7.0, 3.5, 4.0])
```

Other functions such as `np.log()` or trigonometric ones are also available too: 

```{python}
np.log(np.e)
```
The full list of mathematical functions are available at the <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.math.html" target="_blank">NumPy website</a>.
