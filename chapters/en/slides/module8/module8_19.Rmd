# Introduction to Working with Strings

Although we have already introduced you to strings to a certain degree, processing and working with this data type, is an area that will require a substantial amount of learning. 

In this course, we will only scratch the tip of the iceberg when it comes to strings. That being said, we do hope to provide you with an adequate foundation in string processing. 

We saw back in Module 4 that string data is represented in a pandas dataframe using the dtype `object`. This is the default dtype given to columns that have a mix of different data types or if pandas cannot identify the column as any other dtype.

## Recap 

Let's first remind ourselves of some of the functions we've already learned such as:

- `.upper()`
- `.lower()` 
- `.uppercase()`
- `.count()`
- `.split()` 

When we work with just a general string, we can just use the function on the end of the object name. 
For example, if our string object name was `instrument`:

```{python}
instrument = 'Violin'
instrument
```

We could convert to all uppercase characters with: 
```{python}
instrument.upper()
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Convert the string to lowercase:

```{python}
instrument.lower()
```

Count the number of occurrences of the letter "i": 
```{python}
instrument.count('i')
```

And split a string on a specified character (in this case "i"): 
```{python}
instrument.split('i')
```

## Processing String Columns 

The only problem is that when we work with data, we will be applying these transformations, not to a single string, but to a whole column of them. 

Remember when we discussed datetimes columns and we applied time functions to a whole column by adding `.dt` before the function? 

We can use that same syntax style when applying string transformations to entire columns but this time using `.str`.

Let's bring back our `cycling` dataframe to demonstrate:

```{python}
cycling.head()
```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Perhaps we wanted the entire `Comments` column in uppercase. We can use `.assign()` and `.upper` paired with `.str` to transform the column.

```{python}
upper_cycle = cycling.assign(Comments = cycling['Comments'].str.upper())
upper_cycle.head()
```
Not too shabby! 

How about a new column that contains the number of times "RAIN" is counted in `upper_cycle`: 

```{python}
rain_cycle = upper_cycle.assign(Rain = upper_cycle['Comments'].str.count('RAIN'))
rain_cycle.head()
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We've also seen this syntax when we used `str.split()` in Module 4 when we learned about splitting our columns:

```{python}
upper_cycle['Comments'].str.split(expand=True)
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Another operation that we've lightly touched on is combining strings from 2 columns to create a new one:

```{python}
combined_cycle = cycling.assign(Description = cycling['Name'] + cycling['Type'])
combined_cycle.head()
```
or multiple it to repeat a string

```{python}
cycle_tripled = cycling.assign(triple_type = cycling['Type'] * 3)
cycle_tripled.head()
```

---

Two new function we haven't discussed but is quite similar to `.upper()` and `.lower()` is`.capitalize()` which capitalizes the first word of the string:

```{python}
cap_cycle = cycling.assign(Comments = cycling['Comments'].str.capitalize())
cap_cycle.head()
```
And `.title()` that capitalizes every word in a string:

```{python}
cap_cycle = cycling.assign(Comments = cycling['Comments'].str.title())
cap_cycle.head()
```

One function that might not seem that pertinent but is extremely useful is <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.strip.html" target="_blank">`.strip()` </a> :

`strip()` removes characters starting or ending a string, with the default being spaces. 

For Example:

To us, reading "Sunshine" and " Sunshine " are the same thing, but to Python, they are quite different because of the blank space surrounding it. 
```{python}
"Sunshine" == " Sunshine "
```

The blank space on either side of a string often needs to be removed depending on the analysis. 
We can remove them in the example above using `strip()`:

```{python}
string1 = " Sunshine " 
new_string1 = string1.strip()
new_string1
```
```{python}
"Sunshine" == new_string1
```

---

We can apply this to a dataframe column by simple adding `.str`.
In this example let's strip the sides of the `Type` column of the letter "R".

```{python}
stripped_cycling = cycling.assign(Type = cycling['Type'].str.strip("R"))
stripped_cycling
```
