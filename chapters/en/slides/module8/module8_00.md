# Module Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, students are expected to:

- Use NumPy to create ndarrays with `np.array()` and from functions such as `np.arrange()`, `np.linspace()` and `np.ones()`.
- Describe the shape, dimension and size of an array.
- Identify null values in a dataframe and manage them by removing them using `.dropna()` or replacing them using `.fillna()`.
- Manipulate non-standard date/time formats into standard Pandas datetime using `pd.to_datetime()`.
- Find, and replace text from a dataframe using verbs such as `.replace()`.
