## Slicing Dataframe

Up to this point, we have been manipulating our dataframe with column and row _**labels**_  using `.loc[]`.   
Slicing can also be done by the location position of each row with `.iloc[]`.
`.iloc[]` is very similar, however, the "i" in `iloc` refers to the index _**integer**_ position.    

We are going to return to our cereal dataset and take a look at the first 15 rows.

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv')
df.head(15)
```

Let's say we want the rows `All-Bran` to `Apple Cinnamon Cheerios` but we want to slice based on their position.  
Using Python's counting method of starting at zero, we conclude `All-Bran` to be at position to 2.

```{python echo= FALSE}
df.head(7)
```


We get `Apple Cinnamon Cheerios` position to be 5 in the same way.

---

 We can use the same coding structure we learned with `.loc[]`, but this time using row positions instead of labels with `.iloc[]`

```{python}
df.iloc[2:5]
```


But wait! Something is missing here!

Why doesn't `Apple Cinnamon Cheerios` appear in the dataframe?

That's because when we use slicing by index position, it will take all the indices including the lower bound but _EXCLUDING_ the upper bound. If we wanted to include `Apple Cinnamon Cheerios` we would have to go 1 index position further. 

```{python}
df.iloc[2:6]
```


If we think about this a bit it actually make some sense. Think about the calculation `6 - 2 = 4` . We get 4 items remaining which is the amount of cereals we want in our in new dataframe.

The same concept can be appled to the columns of the dataframe. Let's say we want all the rows but we only want the columns starting at `name` and ending (including) at column `sugars`.     
Using the logic we learned in the last set of slides, we would use the following code:

```{python}
df.iloc[:, 0:10]
```

We would need to specify all rows using ` : ` as we did when we used `.loc[]`. The column `name` is at index position 0 (we do not include the index label as a column) and `sugars` is at index position 9. Since we want to include the 9th column we need to use the 10th position to make sure we get all the columns _BEFORE_ the upper bound.

The same would apply if we only wanted certain rows with certain columns. Let’s say we want the rows 
`All-Bran` to `Apple Cinnamon Cheerios` and `protein` to `sugars`.     
**Rows**    
`All-Bran` located at position 2.     
`Apple Cinnamon Cheerios` is located at position 5.     
**Columns**   
`protein` is located at position 4.     
`sugar` is located at position 9.

```{python}
df.iloc[2:6, 0:10]
```


Both of our upper bound have been compensated with + 1 to make sure they are included in the new dataframe.

There are multiple different syntaxes you may want to use when you are selecting items from the begining or end of your data. Perhaps you only want the first 3 rows of your data. We can use `.head(3)` or we can use `.iloc()`. Normally you would this syntax if using the latter:

```{python}
df.iloc[0:3]
```

However, if we are indicating the begining of the dataframe we can omit the `0` just like we learned using `.loc[]`
```{python}
df.iloc[:3]
```

---

We can do something similar for end of a dataframe. This time we want the last 3 rows. 

Instead of writing this:

```{python}
df.iloc[74:77]
```

We can specify a negative number which indicates that we are counting from the other end of the data. Since we are collecting data to the end of the dataframe, we do not need to include the ending row index number. 

```{python}
df.iloc[-3:]
```

## Selecting with .iloc[]

Selecting using `iloc` is done identically to `loc`, however, the items within each set of square brackets **MUST** be integers, and not in quotation marks.

Let’s say we want the rows `Cheerios`, `Basic 4` and `Apple Jacks`  with the columns `name`, `rating`, `fat` and `type` _in that order_.

**Rows**    
`Cheerios` is located at position 11.     
`Basic 4` is located at position 7.    
`Apple Jacks` is located at position 6.

**Columns**  
`name` is located at position 0
`rating` is located at position 15.  
`fat` is located at position 5.    
`type` is located at position 2.  

Notes: Script here.

  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Now let's put those position into square backing within `df.iloc[]`

Recap the locations: 
Rows: `Cheerios` = 11, `Basic 4` = 7 and `Apple Jacks` = 6 
Columns: `name` = 0, `rating` = 15, `fat` = 5 and `type` = 2.   

```{python}
df.iloc[[11, 7, 6], [0, 15, 5, 2]]
```
