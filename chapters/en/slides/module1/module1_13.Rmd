## Unordered Indexing

We have our trusty `cereal.csv` data once again.


```{python echo = FALSE}
df
```


What would we do if we want to select columns and rows that don't fall consecutively or if we want to rearrange them?

Let's say we wanted only the rows labeled `Clusters` (13), `Trix` (73) and `Wheaties` (75) and the columns `name`, `type`, `sugars` and `rating`.
How would we obtain them now?

We need to specify each column and row label that we want between square brackets `[]`, separated with commas:


```{python}
df.loc[[13,73,75], ['name', 'type', 'sugars', 'rating']]
```


We can also reorder the entries to change the column and row order.

What if we wanted the rows to be in the order `Wheaties`, `Trix` and `Clusters` and columns in the order `name`, `type`, `rating` and `sugars`
How would we obtain that?    
It's as simple as rearranging the order you target your rows and columns:

```{python}
df.loc[[75, 73, 13], ['name', 'type', 'rating', 'sugars']]
```
