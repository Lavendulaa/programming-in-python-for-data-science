# Selecting a Single Column


```python
df.loc[:, ['column name']]
```
<br>

```{python}
cereal.loc[:, ['type']]
```

Notes: 

Something we do often in data analysis is obtaining a single column from a dataframe.
We can use `.loc[]` which would look something like this:

`dataframe.loc[:, ['column name']]` 

So if we wanted the column `type` from our cereal dataframe we could use the syntax here. 

This seems a bit long winded and since we do this type of thing often pandas has provided a quicker syntax to use to do the same thing.

``` Python
df[['column name']]
```

<br>


```{python}
cereal[['type']]
```

Notes:

Selecting a single column can be done without using `.loc[]` and instead we can just specify the dataframe name, followed by double square brackets containing the column of interest.

That makes selecting the column `type` from the `cereal` dataframe, look like this.
