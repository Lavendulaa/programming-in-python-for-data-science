# Quick viz with Altair!


Notes:

---



```{python}
cereal
```



Notes: 

If we want to visualize things using different plots we can do that pretty quickly and with little code! 

Take the `cereal` object we analyzed in the last slide deck.

Let say we are interested in the `manufacturer` column. It would be great to express the frequencies of the manufacturers as a bar chart. 

But how do we do it?

---



```{python}
import altair as alt
```

```{python, include=FALSE}
from altair_saver import save
```

Notes: 

To do this, we are going to use a very nifty library called Altair. 

Altair is a data visualization tool that produces plots relatively easily. 

Like any other library we have seen so far, Altair needs to be imported before we can use it.

---

```{python}
chart0 = alt.Chart(cereal).mark_bar().encode(
    x='mfr',
    y='count()'
)
chart0

```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart0.save(path + 'chart0.png')
```

<img src="/module1/chart0.png" alt="A caption" width="20%" />


Notes: 

We can plot the `mfr` column frequencies using Altair using the following code. 

See how quick that was?

Now let's go through the steps.

---

```python
chart0 = alt.Chart(cereal).mark_bar().encode(
    x='mfr',
    y='count()'
)
chart0

```

1. 

```python
alt.chart(...)...
```

2. 

```python
alt.chart(cereal)
```

3. 

```python
alt.chart(cereal).mark_bar()...
```

4. 
```python
alt.chart(cereal).mark_bar().encode(
  x='mfr', 
  y='count()')
```

Notes:

To make a `bar` plot using `altair`, we follow the steps below:

1. We create an `altair` plot object using `alt.chart()`

2. We can pass the dataframe we'd like to plot but putting it in the brackets, in our case it's `cereal`. 

3. But what kind of plot do we want?! 
As we said before, a bar chart in this case would work nicely so let's add the verb `.mark_bar()` to our code. 

4. Next we need to specify what columns we are interested in visualizing. This is done using the `.encode(x='mfr', y='count()')`. 

`count()` is used here to count the occurrences or the number of rows in the cereal dataframe that contains a specific manufacturer.

In general, we use `count()` if we are interested in counting the frequency of each of elements in the `x` variable. 

This gives us all the code necessary for our desired plot now. 

For this example we are saving our plot as an object named `chart0`. 

The important things to notice here is that we want create a `alt.chart()` object and then specify that we want a `.mark_bar()` graph and then specifying which column using `.encode()`. 


---


```{python}
chart1 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_bar().encode(
    x='mfr',
    y='count()'
)
chart1

```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart1.save(path + 'chart1.png')
```

<img src="/module1/chart1.png" alt="A caption" width="50%" />

Notes:

Our previous graph was a bit small. 

We can fix that easily by telling `altair` what height and width the plot should have. 

This can be done by specifying the `height` and `width` argument in the `alt.Chart()` function with arguments named `height` and `width`. 

Let's set the the height and the width of the previous plot to `300` and `500` respectively.

---



```{python}
chart2 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_circle().encode(
    x='sugars',
    y='calories'
)
chart2
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart2.save(path + 'chart2.png')
```

<img src="/module1/chart2.png" alt="A caption" width="50%" />

Notes: 

What else can we plot from our original cereal dataframe named `cereal`? 

Maybe we want to see the relationship between `sugars` and `calories` in cereals?     

This would require a `scatter` plot which can be done by specifying `mark_circle` after creating the `alt.chart()` object.   

In the `.encode()` function, we would need to set the x and y axis with the column names for each axis. 

In this case, the x-axis is the `sugars` column and the y-axis is the `calories` column.    

---


```{python}
chart3 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_circle(opacity=0.3).encode(
    x='sugars',
    y='calories'
)
chart3
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart3.save(path + 'chart3.png')
```

<img src="/module1/chart3.png" width="50%" />

Notes:

Something you may have noticed is that there are 77 cereals but there doesn't seem to be 77 data points! 

That's because some of them are lying on top of each other with the same sugar and calorie values.

It may be of use to set an opacity to the graph to differentiate those points. 

Opacity is set with the argument `opacity` in the `mark_circle()` function and accepts values between 0 and 1, with 1 being full intensity.

Look at that! Now we can see there are multiple cereals that have 3.5g of sugar with 110 calories.

---

```{python}
chart4 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_circle(color='red', opacity=0.3).encode(
    x='sugars',
    y='calories'
)
chart4
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart4.save(path + 'chart4.png')
```

<img src="/module1/chart4.png" width="50%" />

Notes: 

What if you don't fancy the default plot colour `blue`? 

Well that's okay, we can change the colour using the `color` argument in `.mark_circle()`. 

Let's change the colour to `red` (I like red) and keep the same opacity.

---

```{python}
chart5 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_circle(color='red', size=80, opacity=0.3).encode(
    x='sugars',
    y='calories'
)
chart5
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart5.save(path + 'chart5.png')

```

<img src="/module1/chart5.png" width="50%" />

Notes: 

Maybe I have bad eyes, but those data points look pretty small. 

Good news though, we can make them bigger. The argument `size` in the `mark_circle(size=...)` should do the trick.

---

```{python}
chart6 = alt.Chart(cereal, width=500, height=300).mark_circle(color='red', size=80, opacity=0.3).encode(
    x='sugars',
    y='calories'
).properties(title="Scatter plot sugars vs calories for different cereals")
chart6
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart6.save(path + 'chart6.png')
```

<img src="/module1/chart6.png" width="50%" />

Notes: 

Also every good graph should have a title!

A title provides useful information as to what the plot is about.

Let's take this opportunity to finish off our scatter plot graph and set the argument `title` to something as well.

To set the `title`, we use the `title` argument to the `.properties()` function.
