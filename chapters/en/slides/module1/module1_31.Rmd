If we want to visualize things using different plots we can do that pretty quickly and with little code! Take `cereal` object we analyzed in the last slide deck.

```{python}
df
```


Let say we are interested in the `manufacturer` column. This would be great to express as a bar chart. But how do we do it?

---

To do this, we are going to use a very nifty package called `altair`. Altiar is a new data visualization tool that produces plots relatively easily. Like any other packages we have seen so far, `altair` needs to be imported before we can use it.

```{python}
import altair as alt
from altair_saver import save
```

To make a `bar` plot using `altair`, we follow the steps below:

1. We take the dataframe we wish to plot, in this case `df`.
2. We create an `altair` plot object using `alt.chart()`.
3. We can pass the dataframe we'd like to plot by using `alt.chart(df)`
4. But what kind of plot do we want?! A bar chart in this case would work nicely so lets add `.mark_bar()` after that.
5. Now that we have specified that we want a `bar` plot from our `df`, we need to specify what column. This is done using the `.encode(x='mfr', y='count()')`. The `count` here says that we would like to count up all the occurrences of the different manufacturers.
6. Putting it all together, we have ```alt.chart(df).mark_bar().encode(x='mfr', y='count()')```. Lets see how this looks on the next slide.

---

```{python}
# Note that the setting the width and height is for consistency.

chart1 = alt.Chart(df, width=500, height=300).mark_bar().encode(
    x='mfr',
    y='count()'
)
chart1

```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart1.save(path + 'chart1.png')
```

<img src="/module1/chart1.png" alt="A caption" width="40%" />

See how quick that was?
The important things to notice here is that we want create a `alt.chart()` object and then specify that we want a `.mark_bar()` graph and then specifying which column using `.encode()`. 

---

What else can we plot from our original cereal dataframe named `df`? Maybe we want to see the relationship between `sugars` and `calories` in cereals?        
This would require a `scatter` plot which can be done by specifying `mark_circle` after creating the `alt.chart()` object.     
In the `.encode()` function, we would need to specify the x and y axis which means we would need to specify the column names for each axis; In this case the x-axis is the `sugars` column and the y-axis is the `calories` column.    

```{python}
chart2 = alt.Chart(df, width=500, height=300).mark_circle().encode(
    x='sugars',
    y='calories'
)
chart2
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart2.save(path + 'chart2.png')
```

<img src="/module1/chart2.png" alt="A caption" width="45%" />

Something you may have noticed is that there are 77 cereals but there doesn't seem to be 77 data points! That's because some of them are lying on top of each other with the same sugar ar calorie values. It may be of use to set an opacity to the graph to differential those points. Opacity is set with the argument `opacity` in the `mark_circle(opacity=...)` function and accepts values between 0 and 1, with 1 being full intensity.

```{python}
# lets set the opacity to 30%
chart3 = alt.Chart(df, width=500, height=300).mark_circle(opacity=0.3).encode(
    x='sugars',
    y='calories'
)
chart3
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart3.save(path + 'chart3.png')
```

<img src="/module1/chart3.png" width="45%" />

Look at that! Now we can see there are multiple cereals that have 2.5g of sugar with 100 calories.
So what if you don't fancy the color the default color `blue`? Well that is okay, we can change the color using the `color` argument in the `.mark_circle(color=...)` function. Lets change the color to `red`(I like red) while keeping the same opacity.

```{python}
# lets set the opacity to 30%
chart4 = alt.Chart(df, width=500, height=300).mark_circle(color='red', opacity=0.3).encode(
    x='sugars',
    y='calories'
)
chart4
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart4.save(path + 'chart4.png')
```

<img src="/module1/chart4.png" width="45%" />

Maybe I have bad eyes, but those data points look pretty small. Good news though, we can make them bigger (bigger is better?) To enlarge them, the argument `size` in the `mark_circle(size=..)` should do the trick.


```{python}
# lets set the opacity to 30%
chart5 = alt.Chart(df, width=500, height=300).mark_circle(color='red', size=12, opacity=0.3).encode(
    x='sugars',
    y='calories'
)
chart5
```

Also every good graph should have a title! A title provides useful information as to what the plot is about. Let's take this opportunity to finish off our scatter plot graph and set the argument `title` to something as well. To set the `title`, we use the `title` argument to the `.properties(title=..)` function.

```{python}
# lets set the opacity to 30%
chart6 = alt.Chart(df, width=500, height=300).mark_circle(color='red', size=12, opacity=0.3).encode(
    x='sugars',
    y='calories'
).properties(title="Scatter plot sugars vs calories for different cereals")
chart6
```


```{python include =FALSE}
chart6.save(path + 'chart6.png')
```
