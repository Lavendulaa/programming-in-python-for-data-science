# Summary Statistics

Notes:

---

```{python}
cereal = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv')
cereal.head(15)
```

Notes: 

Now we've learned about how to get our dataframe how we want it, let's try have  some fun with it!

We have our data, now what? 

We usually like to learn from it. We want to find out about maybe some summary statistics about the features of the data. 

Let's load in our cereal dataset again. 

---

## Numerical and Categorical Columns 



### Categorical data

Consists of qualitative observations such as characteristics - things generally containing names or words. 

**Examples**      

- Colours
- Names 

<br>

### Numerical data

These data are usually expressed with numbers. 

**Examples**    

- Measurements
- Quantities


Notes: 

Before we go further, let's quickly discuss the 2 different types of data.  

Our columns in our dataframe are considered one of the two of these.

---

## Pandas describe()


```{python}
cereal.describe()
```


Notes:

Pandas has a lot up its sleeve but one of the most useful methods is called `.describe()` and it does exactly that. it _describes_ our data.  

Let's try it out.

By default `df.describe()` only shows numerical columns.

---

```{python}
cereal.describe()
```


- `count`: The number of non-NA/null observations.
- `mean`: The mean of  column 
- `std` : The standard deviation of a column
- `min`: The min value for a column
- `max`: The max value for a column 
- By default the 25, 50 and 75 percentile of the observations

Notes:

This table will tell us about different summary statics including the following. 

---

```{python}
cereal.describe(include='all')
```

- `unique`: how many observations are unique
- `top`: which observation value is most occurring
- `freq`: what is the frequency of the most occurring observation 

Notes: 

We can make changes to either limit how much is shown or include more statistic in the dataframe with the additional argument `include = "all"` in the `describe` brackets.

This expands the dataframe to contain both categorical and numerical columns now. 

Adding `include='all'` within the brackets adds some additional statistics about categorical columns.

---

```{python}
ratings = cereal[['protein']]
ratings.mean()
```


```{python}
ratings = cereal[['rating']]
ratings.sum()
```

What about median calories of the cereals. 


```{python}
calories = cereal[['calories']]
calories.median()
```


Notes: 

We can also get single statistics of each column using:
either `.mean()`,`.std()`, `.count()`, `.median()`, `.sum()`. 

First segregate the column we want to explore further, then add the verb. 
As an example, what the sum of the cereal ratings?

what the mean protein content of the cereals?

Or the sum of the cereal ratings?

What about median calories of the cereals? 

---

```{python}
cereal.mean()
```

Notes: 

We can also use these summary statistic verbs on the entire dataframe. This now shows the mean value of each column in the dataframe. 

You'll notice that only the numerical variables are calculated which makes sense since we would not be able to calculate the mean of categorical data.
