Now we've learned about how to get our dataframe how we want it, let's try and make some fun of it!

We have our data, now what? 

We usually like to learn from it. We want to find out about maybe some summary statistics about the features of the data. 

Let's load in our cereal dataset again.

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv')
df.head(15)
```

## Numerical and Categorical Columns 

Before we go further, let's quickly discuss the 2 different types of data.  

- Categorical data: consists of qualitative observations such as characteristics - things generally containing names or words. 
- Numerical data: are usually expressed with numbers. 

This means that in our dataframe our columns can be classified as either of these.

## Pandas describe()

Pandas has a lot up its sleeve but one of the most useful methods is called `.describe()` and it does exactly that. it _describes_ our data.  Let's try it out. 


```{python}
df.describe()
```

By default `df.describe()` only shows numerical columns.

---

```{python echo=FALSE}
df.describe()
```


This table will tell us about:

- `count`: The number of non-NA/null observations.
- `mean`: The mean of  column 
- `std` : The standard deviation of a column
- `min`: The min value for a column
- `max`: The max value for a column 
- By default the 25, 50 and 75 percentile of the observations

---

We can make changes to either limit how much is shown or extend it with the additional argument `include = "all"` in the `describe` brackets. This expands the dataframe to contain both categorical and numerical columns now. 

```{python}
df.describe(include='all')
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

```{python echo=FALSE}
df.describe(include='all')
```

Adding `include='all'` within the brackets adds some additional statistics about categorical columns.

- `unique`: how many observations are unique
- `top`: which observation value is most occuring
- `freq`: what is the frequency of the most occuring observation

We can also get single statistics of each column using:
either `.mean()`,`.std()`, `.count()`, `.median()`, `.sum()`. 

First segregate the column we want to explore further, then add the method. 
As an example, what the sum of the cereal ratings?


```{python}
ratings = df[['rating']]
ratings.sum()
```

What about median calories of the cereals. 


```{python}
calories = df[['calories']]
calories.median()
```

We can also use this on the entire dataframe. 

```{python}
df.mean()
```

You'll notice that only the numerical variables are calculated which makes sense since we would not be able to calculate the mean of categorical data.
