## What is Frequency?

Before we explain what a frequency table is, you must know what frequency means first. 

_*Frequency*_ is simply put, the number of times a value occurs within the data. For example, let's say we have a sample of our candybars data. 

```{python}
df_mini
```

The frequency of the value `Both` in the `available_canada_america` column is 3. 

A frequency table is a manner of displaying all the possible values of a column in our data and the number of occurrences (frequencies) each value occurs. These are particularly useful when we want to visualize our data.

## What is a Frequency Table?

_*A frequency Table*_ is a manner of displaying all the possible values of a column in our data and the number of occurrences (frequencies) each value occurs. These are particularly useful when we want to visualize our data.

For our sample data, a frequency table for the `available_canada_america` column would look like this: 

```{python echo=FALSE}

df_mini['available_canada_america'].value_counts()
```

If we want to get a frequency table of a categorical column, there are a few steps that need to be followed. 
Up untill now,  we discussed getting a single column from a dataframe using double brackets - `df[['column-name']]`. For frequency tables, however, we only use single brackets to obtain the column values.

```{python}
manufacturer_column = df['mfr']
manufacturer_column
```

We saved the object in a variable called `manufacturer_column` in the same way we have saved objects before.    
Next we can use `.value_counts()` referencing that the column we saved as `manufacturer_column`.  


```{python}
manufacturer_freq = manufacturer_column.value_counts()
manufacturer_freq
```

We can then see the frequency of each qualitative value.
If we used double square brackets with `pd.value_counts()` we would get an error along the lines of `AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'value_counts'`. Take care with using the correct number of square brackets.

Sometimes it's useful to save a new dataframe as a `csv` file for future use or to use in another application. We can save dataframes using the method `.to_csv()`. Simply put our desired `csv` file name in quotations within the parentheses. 

```{python echo = FALSE}
manufacturer_freq.to_csv('manufacturer_frequency.csv')
```
