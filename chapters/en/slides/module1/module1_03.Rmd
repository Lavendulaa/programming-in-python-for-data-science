## Importing Pandas

To analyze dataframes and load these `csv` files, we need to make sure that we import something called `pandas`. 

Before we start writing any valuable code, we import it with the following code. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```

## Reading in Data

Next we can bring in our data  named `candybars` which is stored as a `.csv`:

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', index_col=0)
```

let's break this up:

`pd`: this is the short form for pandas, which we are using to manipulate our dataframes.  
`read_csv()`: The tool that does the job and, in this case, it is reading in the `csv` file named `candybars.csv`.    
`index_col=0`: This specifies to use the first column in the csv as an index (we will talk about this shortly).          
`df`: The dataframe is now saved as an object called `df`.

In these slides you can differentiate between what we typed in (our code) in light gray and the output of it, which will be coloured with a dark grey background.

The dataframe is stored in an object named `df` and looks like this:

```{python}
df
```

  <source src="/placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

From this dataframe, we can see that there are 25 different candy bars and 10 columns.
We can obtain the names of the columns using this code:

```{python}
df.columns
```

Or if you wanted to see the dimensions of the whole dataframe you could code the following:

```{python}
df.shape
```


Breaking up this code it just means "From our dataframe that we saved as `df` tell me the `columns`/`shape`".

What if we don't want to output the whole table when displaying a dataframe?
We can specify how many rows of the dataset to show with `.head()`.  This will output the first few rows of the dataframe. 

```{python}
df.head(2)
```


The above code specifies only 2 rows to display. We can specify any number of rows within the parentheses or we can leave it empty which will default to the first 5 rows.



```{python}
df.head()
```

## Functions/Methods and Attributes

Something you may have noticed is that when we use `pd.read_csv()` we put our instructions within the parentheses, whereas, when we use `.shape` or `.head()` the object comes before our desired command. In Python, we use  **functions**, **methods** and  **attributes**. These are special words in Python that takes in instructions (we call these arguments) and do something.


<center> <img src='/module1/argument.png'  alt="404 image"  width="50%" align="middle"/></center>

Attributes can be distinguished from methods and functions as they do not have parentheses.          
They can be thought of as nouns or adjectives that describe an object.          

Take `df.shape` as an example.       
In this case, our dataframe `df` is our object and `.shape` is the attribute describing it.

<br>

Functions and methods have parentheses.        
They can be thought of as verbs that complete an action.          
In the example of `pd.read_csv()`, this function does the action of reading in your data. 


This is going to be discussed in more detail later in the course but now, simply be aware of the way we write different instructions.

## Comments 

While we write code, it's often useful to annotate it or include information that you do not want to excuted. 
The easiest way to do this is with a hash (`#`) symbol. This creates a single line comment and prevents anything written after it from being executed. 

```{python}
# This line does not excute anything. 
```

You can also use it beside code. 

```{python eval=FALSE}
df.shape  # This will output the shape of the dataframe
```

You'll notice we use comments frequently in the exercises. It's good practice to use them to explain your code so if you or someone else wants to read it at a later date, it's easier to understand.
