**Question 1**         
Tidy data is defined differently for every dataset.

Let's melt this so that the 2 new columns named `matte` and `transparent` become a single one.  These columns refer to the opacity of the blocks and the values refer to the number of pieces of each included in the set. 

Tasks:

- `melt` the dataframe columns `matte` and `transparent` into a single column named `opacity` and name the values column `quantity`.
- Assign `set_num` ad the index in your new dataframe. 
- Name the new dataframe `tidied_lego`.

Let's find the minimum and the maximum number of pieces per set there are in each Lego theme. 

Tasks:

Sometimes we accumulate additional data that we need to combine with our existing data.  In the following question, we need to combine our dataframes to have a complete collection of all the Lego sets that exist. 

Tasks:

- Combine the two dataframes `lego_top` and `lego_bottom` vertically to make one large complete dataframe.
- Name the new dataframe `full_set`.
- Save the new dimension of `full_set` in an object named `full_set_shape`.

Our goal is to obtain a dataframe with the `lego_set` names and the total amount of pieces in each set but we only have 2 Lego dataframes (with the same indexes).  One dataframe has the set names and the other contains information amount the number of matte and transparent pieces included in each set.  Complete this question by using `pd.concat()` and techniques we learned in the previous model.

Tasks:

- Combine the two dataframes horizontally to make 1 large complete dataframe using an outer join.
- Name the new dataframe `lego_full`.
- Make a new column named `total_pieces` by adding up columns `matte` and `transparent`.
- Sort the dataframe by `total_pieces` in descending order.

In this exercise you are going to join two dataframes `lego_inventory_parts.csv` and `lego-colors.csv` and answer a few multiple-choice questions.  The multiple-choice questions are being asked with the intention of using the code cell to write your own code in any way that helps to answer the question. 


Tasks:

This question may be a bit more challenging.  We are wondering about the inventory of a store.  We want to see which Lego sets are in stock and if so how many?  After all, the store needs to make sure there are enough sets in stock to meet demand. 

Tasks:
- Combine the two dataframes to make one large complete dataframe by using an inner join.
- Name the new dataframe `lego_stock`.
- Group the new dataframe by `set_num` and find how many groups there are using `.ngroups`

This question is in two parts and we are going to walk you through how to tackle it.

</codeblock>


Ah, it appears we have multiple rows for some of the same sets.   
How are we going to get the stock quantity of each set?    
We are going to have to sum up the quantity of each set.  Luckily we can do this with the skills we have already learned! 

Tasks:
- Use `.groupby()` and `.agg()` to sum up the quantity of each set and save this as `store_inventory`. 
- Inner join `store_inventory` with `lego_sets` and use chaining to sort the dataframe in descending order based on in-stock quantity
- Save this new dataframe as store_inventory_details 
- Display the new dataframe.
