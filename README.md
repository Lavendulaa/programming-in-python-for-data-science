For a direct link to the course website, please click [here](https://mcl-dsci-511-programming-in-python.netlify.app/en).

This was built using a [framework](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python) made by [@ines](https://github.com/ines) as well as recent changes made to her [SpaCy course](https://github.com/ines/spacy-course). 

We are attempting to have this launching in July 2020.
