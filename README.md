For a direct link to the course website, please click [here](https://prog-learn.mds.ubc.ca/en).

This was built using a [framework](https://github.com/ines/course-starter-python) made by [@ines](https://github.com/ines) as well as recent changes made to her [SpaCy course](https://github.com/ines/spacy-course). 

We are attempting to have this launch in September 2020.
