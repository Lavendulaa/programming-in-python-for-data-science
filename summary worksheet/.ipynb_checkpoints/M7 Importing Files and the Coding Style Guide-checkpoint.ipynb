    "All the way back in Module 1, we learned how to import the pandas library for dataframe wrangling and altair to visualize our data with plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "We imported these libraries because basic Python does not have all the built-in tools that we need to accomplish what we want; therefore, we import other tools into our environment.\n",

    "To import a library, we saw that we can use the keyword import followed by the desired package name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we are importing pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "This now lets us use verbs that reside in the pandas library, such as read_csv().\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to specify the library name -pandas and then the verb - read_csv().\n"
