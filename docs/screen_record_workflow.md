# Screen Recording Videos Workflow

## Using Camtasia

- Make your recording section as large as possible.
- If using a browser, hide your "favourites" and enter full screen mode. (On a Mac -> press the green button on the top left of a window) 
- Save your file in two ways: 
    - Save it as a .cmproj file by going to File > Save As 
    - Save it as a .mp4 file by going to Share > Local File > Options. Make sure to change the Dimensions to 3840 X 2160 4K. Use a Frame Rate of 30 frames/sec.
- These can then be put into a dropbox and send to him for editing. 

## Other Recommendations 
- Use a microphone for the cleanest audio.
- Take up a large amount of head room in your face recording.
- Use a plain background.
- Set up the face recording as far to the right as right as possible.
