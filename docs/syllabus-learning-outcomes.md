# Course Syllabus and Learning Outcome 

## Course Learning Outcomes 

- Define tidy data and explain why it is an optimal format for data analysis.
- Transform data into the tidy data format using pandas.
- Explain the relationship between numpy.ndarray, pandas.series and pandas.dataframe objects.
- Move data fluidly between these object types (within one language).
- Read data  into Python data from vanilla (e.g., .csv) and non-standard plain text files, as well as common spreadsheet file types (e.g., .xls).
- Manipulate a single data table by:
    - Filtering rows based on a criterion or combination of criteria
    - Selecting variables
    - Creating new variables and modifying pre-existing ones
    - Rearranging the observations or variables in a deliberate way (e.g., sorting).
- Manage and manipulate data with dates and times, missing values and categorical variables as well as renaming data frame columns.
- Use the split-apply-combine approach to iterate over and summarize data by groups.
- Translate fundamental programming concepts such as loops and conditionals into Python code.
- Understand the key data structures in Python.
- Understand how to write functions and assess if they are correct via unit testing.
- Produce human-readable code that incorporates best practices of programming and coding style.


## Modules 

### Module 1: Python, Pandas and Data - an unexpected friendship!
#### Topics 
- Tidy data - what it is
- Understanding Dataframes 
- Simple table manipulations (Selecting, filtering) using Pandas.
- Saving Dataframes as variables
- Numpy, Data frames in Python with Pandas and the relationship with Numpy. 
- Going back and forth between Numpy & Pandas.
- Getting Tidy data (melt & pivot).
- 

#### Learning Outcomes 
By the end of the module, students are expected to:
- Explain what Tidy data is
- Describe the components of a Dataframe
- Use NumPy to create ndarrays from existing data with np.array() and from functions such as np.arange(), np.linspace() and np.full().
- Read a standard .csv file using Pandas pd.read_csv().
- Demonstrate indexing and slicing with df.loc[] and df.iloc[]
- Explain what broadcasting is and how to use it (quickly????)
- Select and filter columns of a dataframe using df[] notation.
- Compare and contrast np.ndarray, pd.Series and pd.DataFrame objects.
