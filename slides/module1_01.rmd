# What is a Dataframe?

When working with information, it must be stored in a manner that is organized, readable and accessible.    

A dataframe makes it easy to calculate statistics and clean and store data.

From a data perspective, it is a rectangle where the rows are the observations. 
(Essentially, they look like excel sheets)

The columns are the variables.

## Importing Pandas

To analyze dataframes, we need to make sure that we import something called `pandas`. This will help us store and manipulate dataframes. 

Before we start writing any valuable code, we need to import pandas. 

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```

## Reading in Data

Next we can bring in our data  named `candybars` which is stored as a `.csv` with the following code:

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv')
```

let's break this up:

`pd`: this is the short form for pandas, which we are using to manipulate our dataframes.  
`read_csv()`: The tool that does the job and, in this case, it is reading in the `csv` file named `candybars.csv`.   
`df`: The dataframe is now saved as an object called `df`

In these slides you can differentiate between what we typed in (our code) in light gray and the output of this will be coloured in a dark grey background. 

You can see what the object `df` looks like on the next slide.

```{python}
df
```

From this dataframe, we can see that there are 25 different candy bars and 10 columns.
We can obtain the names of the columns using this code:

```{python}
df.columns
```

Or if you wanted to see the dimensions of the whole dataframe you could code the following:

```{python}
df.shape
```


Breaking up this code it just means "From our dataframe that we saved as `df` tell me the  `columns` or tell me the `shape`".

Another important method to know is what if we don't want to output the whole table   
We can then specify how many rows of the dataset to show with `df.head()`

```{python}
df.head(2)
```


This specifies only 2 rows will be shown. We can specify any number of rows within the brackets or we can leave it empty which will default to 5 rows.


```{python}
df.head()
```
