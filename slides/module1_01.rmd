## What is a Dataframe? 

Often, the first thing we need to do in data analysis is to load in data. 
In this case, we will be using the programming language _Python_.
When we bring spreadsheet-like (think Microsoft Excel tables) data, generally shaped like a rectangle, into Python, it is represented as what we call a dataframe object. It is very similar to a spreadsheet.

The rows in a dataframe are the collected observations.

And the columns are the variables.

When working with information, it must be stored in a manner that is organized, readable and accessible.

## What is a CSV file?

The first kind of data we will learn how to load into Python (as a data frame) is the spreadsheet-like comma-separated values format (.csv for short). These files have names ending in .csv, and can be opened open and saved from common spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.

For example, we will be importing the .csv file you saw in the first slide named "candybars.csv". If we were to open this data in a plain text editor, we would see each row on its own line, and each entry in the table separated by a comma:
