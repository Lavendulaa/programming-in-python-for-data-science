# Building on things we know

In the last module we explored `.loc[]` and how it can help slice and select specific columns and rows in a dataframe.  The power of it, however, is not limited to just that.  This section marks the return of `.loc[]` and how it can replace certain values within a dataframe that meet specified conditions. 

Keeping with our routine, we are bringing in our cereal dataset in once again.  Are you starting to get familiar with it yet? 

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv', index_col=0)
df.head()
```

# The return of loc

In the previous module we discussed how `.loc[]` take the _*location*_ of specified columns and rows labels of the dataframe and returns them. 
In this module, `loc[]` will be used to locate specific rows conditionally on certain column values similarly to how filtering is done without `loc[]`, however.  now we are replacing the column value. 

In our cereal dataframe, the manufacturer value "Q" isn't that informative and it might be easier to understand if we change all these values to something more understandable like "Quaker".

Let's start by simply finding all the cereals made by the "Quaker Oats" manufacturer: 

```{python}
df.loc[df['mfr'] == 'Q']
```

You may look at the above syntax and think "Wait, we did something similar when we were filtering in the last section?".  You're right! 

We used similar syntax when we filter, however, now we've added the verb `.loc[]`.  To replace "Q" with "Quaker", however,  we need to indicate which column we are editing as the second argument (which we can't do, if we leave out `.loc[]`).  In this example, we are editing the `mfr` column. 
This code results in a single column dataframe with only "Q" values.

```{python}
df.loc[df['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr']  
```

---

Lastly, to complete our code we need to specify what we want to change the values to!  In our example, we are replacing "Q" with "Quaker".

```{python}
df.loc[df['mfr'] == 'Q', 'mfr'] = 'Quaker'
```

Wait!  Nothing was outputted with this code!  What happened?  Let's take a look at our dataframe.

```{python}
df.head()
```

I can now see that `100% Natural Bran's` manufacturer value has changed to `Quaker` but what about the rest of them?

Let's filter and see!

```{python}
df[df['mfr'] == 'Quaker']  
```

Great, all the "Q" values have been replaced with "Quaker". 
We see that when we use this syntax, we do not need to save the results in a new object name like we had to with `.assign()` and `.drop()`.

# Replacing with Inequalities. 

This also works for inequality conditions.

If we are replacing numerical values with characters or words (or vice versa) we need to assign our desired values to a new column and not the existing one.
Perhaps we want just 2 categories for protein levels "high" and "low".  Any cereal above 3 grams of protein will be considered a "high" protein level and anything less, as a "low" protein level. 

Let's assign the "high" protein values first.  The only differences here from earlier is we now use an inequality for our condition and we designate a new column name instead of an existing one.  Let's save the values in a column named `protein_level`.

```{python}
df.loc[df['protein'] >= 3, 'protein_level']  = 'High' 
```

Next by the "low" values.

```{python}
df.loc[df['protein'] < 3, 'protein_level']  = 'low' 
```
Let's see the results 
```{python}
df.head()
```

Super!
