## Reading in Different File Types 

In the last module we learned how to read in a `csv` file but we are not restricted to that file type.     
`pandas` facilitates the loading of data from many different file types including:

- A `URL`: If the data is stored publicly on a webpage, pandas can read it directly in from the page address. 
- A `txt` file: We saw what a plain text file looked like in the last module and it is generally a simple manner of storing data.  
- An `xlsx` file: This is a classic Excel spreadsheet. This is different than a regular `csv` file as an Excel file can contain many different sheets and can be formated uniquely and specifically for an idividual's needs. 

Of course there are many others , but we will focus on these for this course.

## Reading from a URL

If the data is accessible publicly on a website, you can read in data directly from the webpage it is stored on. 
For example, this code and all the files that make up this course is all open and can be [viewed online](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/MCL-DSCI-511-programming-in-python). The `candybar.csv` file that we used in the last module is stored at this url:  
[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-MDS/MCL-DSCI-511-programming-in-python/master/data/candybars.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-MDS/MCL-DSCI-511-programming-in-python/master/data/candybars.csv)      
You can see that it looks like a plain `txt` file with each line being a row and each column value separated with a comma. 

The code required to read in this url looks like this:

```{python}

candybars = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-MDS/MCL-DSCI-511-programming-in-python/master/data/candybars.csv')
candybars.head()
```

It uses the same `pd.read_csv()` function we saw when reading in `csv` files.      
Pretty simple right?

## Reading in a Text File

Reading in `txt` files can be a little less standard in nature. Sometimes the character separating column values are not always commas like we saw above. There are many different options and when we read in the data, we need to specify how how data needs to be recognized. 
Let's load in the `candybars-text.txt` file. This is the same candybar data but saved as a `txt1 file. Let's see what happen's when we load it in using the same syntax we are use to. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-text.txt')
candybars.head()
```

Oh no! This is not ideal. What you should notice is instead of each column value being separated by a column, it is now separated by `\t`. This is called the *Delimiter*.

---

 We need to tell `pd.read_csv()` to separate each value on our delimiter `\t`. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-text.txt', delimiter='\t')
candybars.head()
```

Ah. That's much better.  We are not married to the delimiter being `\t`. We can specify any character combination to accomodate other data files.

## Reading in an Excel File (`xlsx`) 

Excel files need special attention because they give the user the capability of additional formating including saving multiple dataframes on different "sheets" within a single file. This means that if that is the case, we need to specify which one we want.
Since this is a new type of animal we also need a new function. Enter `read_excel()`. 

We have our candybars dataframe saved as an excel spreadsheet named `foods.xlsx` on a sheet named `candybars`.    
Here is how we would read it in:   

```{python}

candybars = pd.read_excel('foods.xlsx', sheet_name='candybars')
candybars.head()
```

## Reading in Data from a Different File

Something you've seen in the previous exercises is that when we  read in the data there is alway a `data/` before the file name.    
This is because the file we are running the current code in, is located in a different folder than the data. 
The `data` folder is a folder in our current directory (folder). We need to specify the path to the `csv` file through the subfile.


<center> <img src='module2/datafile.png'  alt="404 image"  width="50%" align="middle"/></center>


This translates to the syntax `data/canucks.csv`

</audio></html>

--- 

This syntax is not restricted to a single subfolder and could even have multiple folder between the current location and the final file name. 
     
_Example:_ `data/module1/question3/candybars.csv`

In this course we save all our data in a file called `data` so when asked to read in data, take care in future exercises to add the full path to the required file.
