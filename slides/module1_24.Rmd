## Sorting

When we load in our data, it is generally ordered in the same way it is stored.  We can easily sort the rows of a dataframe based on its column values. 
The verb for that?  `df.sort_values()`.

As an example, if we wanted to order the cereals based on rating, we could do the following:

```{python}
df.sort_values(by='rating')
```

This allows us to see the cereals with lower ratings on the top.

What if we wanted the cereals with a higher rating on the top?  Then we would order them in `descending` order by setting the parameter `ascending=False`:

```{python}
sorted_ratings = df.sort_values(by='rating', ascending=False)
sorted_ratings
```

Perfect, now we have the highest rated cereals at the top of the dataframe.
