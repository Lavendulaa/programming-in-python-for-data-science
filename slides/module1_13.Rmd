So to answer the question where we left off, after giving it a try, you know that rearranging column or row order is as easy as changing the column name order!

So if we wanted the rows to be in the order  `Wheaties`, `Trix` and `Clusters` and columns in the order `type`, `rating` and `sugars` from our cereal dataframe,
we would obtain it like so:

```{python}
df.loc[ ["Wheaties", "Trix", "Clusters"] , ["type", "rating", "sugars"] ]
```

# Selecting a Single Column

Something extremely useful is getting a single column from a dataframe.
We can use `df.loc[]` which would look something like this:

```
df.loc[ : , [ "column-name"] ]
```

For example, if we wanted the column `type` from our cereal dataframe.
```{python}
df.loc[ : , [ "type"] ]
```

But there is a better way of doing this.

You can omit `loc` altogether and use double square brackets:

``` Python
df[['column-name']]
```

Selecting the column `type` would be as simple as so:

```{python}
df[['type']]
```
