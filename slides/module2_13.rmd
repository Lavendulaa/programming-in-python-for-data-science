Doing some sort of transformation on the columns of a dataframe will most likely come up in your analysis somewhere and it's not always straight forward.

Let's welcome back the `cereal.csv` data we have worked with in Module 1. 


```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv', index_col=0)
df.head()
```

To make things especially clear, for the next few scenarios let only use the first 5 rows of the dataset.

```{python}
df = df.iloc[ 0: 5]
df
```

Perhaps we recently read some documentation regarding the `fat` column in the data is being expressed as the number of grams of fat above 2.  This means that the actual fat content of each cereal is actually an additional 2 grams.  How do we rectify this?

---

We need to add 2 to each of the row's fat value.

---

Here is where some magic happens.  Python doesn't require us to make a whole column filled with 2s to get the result we want.  It would simply add 2 to each column.

```{python}
df['fat'] + 2
```

Notice how each row has changed in value. Notice that for operations on columns, we use single square brackets.

---

We can do the same thing with multiplication/division too.
let's multiply the rating of each cereal by 2. 
Note that  `*` is used in Python for multiplication.  

```{python}
df['rating'] * 2
```

Every rows value is changed by the operation.

We are not limited to simply taking a column and transforming it by a single number. We can do operations involving multiple columns as well.  Perhaps we wanted to know the amount of sugar (`sugar`) per cup of cereal (`cups`).

The expected result would look something like this:


<center> <img src='module2/sugarcups.png'  alt="404 image" /></center>

  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Keeping with the syntax of using only single square brackets on our columns, to get our desired output we can do the following. 
Each sugar row value is divided by its respected cups value.

```{python}
df['sugars'] / df['cups']
```


Notes: Script here

<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Just to stress the point of why we use single square brackets for our operation here is what happens when we use double square brackets:

```{python}
df[['sugars']] / df[['cups']]
```

Not very useful for us.

Up until now, all of these operations have been done without being added to our cereal dataframe.  Let's explore how we can add new columns to our complete cereal dataframe.

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv', index_col=0)
df
```

## Column Creation

Now we have decided that we want a column in the dataframe that shows the weight of each cereal in grams instead of ounces
We can add this to our current dataframe using the `assign` function.  
We are going to save the conversion factor of grams to ounces in an object named `oz_to_g` to add some clarity and flexibility to our code.
The operation for this desired result would be:

```{python}
oz_to_g = 28.3495
df['weight'] * oz_to_g
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Let's combine this with the `assign()` verb so that we can save this as a new column in our dataframe named `weight_g`. 

```{python}
df = df.assign(weight_g=df['weight'] * oz_to_g)
df.head()
```

Perfect!
Remember from earlier in module 2 how it's important that we always save the dataframe to an object when making changes involving columns.

We learned how to do operations involving multiple columns in a dataframe  let's implement this by saving the results as a new column.
This time adding a column indicating how many calories there are in 1 cup of each cereal.

The operation for this would be


```{python}
df['calories'] / df['cups']
```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---


let's combine this with `assign()` naming the column `cals_per_cup`.

```{python}
df = df.assign(cals_per_cup=df['calories'] / df['cups'])
df.head()
```

Great! let's put this to practice.
