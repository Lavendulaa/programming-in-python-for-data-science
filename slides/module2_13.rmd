Doing some sort of transformation on the columns of a dataframe will most likely come up in your analysis somewhere and it's not always straight forward.
Let's welcome back the `cereal.csv` data we have worked with in Module 1. 


```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv', index_col=0)
df.head()
```

To make things especially clear, for the next few scenarios let only use the first 5 rows of the dataset.

```{python}
df = df.iloc[0:5]
df
```

Let's explore the next scenario. Perhaps we recently read the cereal data's documentation explaining that the `fat` column is being expressed as the number of grams of fat above 2.   
This means that the fat content of each cereal is actually an additional 2 grams.  How can we rectify this?

  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We need to add 2 to each of the row's fat value.

---

Here is where some magic happens.  Python doesn't require us to make a whole column filled with 2s to get the result we want.  It would simply add 2 to each column.

```{python}
df['fat'] + 2
```

See how each row has changed in value? When we do any type of operations on columns, we use single square brackets.

---

We can do the same thing with multiplication/division too.     
let's multiply the rating of each cereal by 2.       
In Python we use `*` for multiplication.  

```{python}
df['rating'] * 2
```

Every row's value is changed by the operation.

We are not limited to simply taking a column and transforming it by a single number. We can do operations involving multiple columns as well.  Perhaps we wanted to know the amount of sugar (`sugar`) per cup of cereal (`cups`).

The expected result would look something like this:

  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Remember with any column operation we use only single square brackets on our columns.   
To get our desired output of sugar content per cup our code looks like this:

```{python}
df['sugars']/df['cups']
```

Each sugar row value is divided by its respected cups value.

---

Just to stress the point of why we use single square brackets for our operations, here is what happens when we use double square brackets:

```{python}
df[['sugars']]/df[['cups']]
```

This doesn't appear very useful.

---

Up until now, all of these operations have been done without being added to our cereal dataframe.  Let's explore how we can add new columns to our complete cereal dataframe.

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv', index_col=0)
df
```

## Column Creation

In the next scenario, we have decided that a column in the dataframe that shows the weight of each cereal in grams instead of ounces is needed.
   
We are going to save the conversion factor of grams to ounces in an object named `oz_to_g` to add some clarity and flexibility to our code.   
  
Let's start with just the operation for this desired result:

```{python}
oz_to_g = 28.3495
df['weight']*oz_to_g
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Next, we combine our operation with the implementation of adding it as a new column to the dataframe. 
The verb `.assign()` allows us to specify a  column name to our operation using just an equal sign `=`.    

We are going to name our new column `weight_g`. 

```{python}
df = df.assign(weight_g=df['weight']*oz_to_g)
df.head()
```


Just like we did earlier in the module, we need to save the dataframe to an object when making changes involving columns. This will permanently save the column `weight_g` to the dataframe `df`.

---

Let's try another example. 
This time we want to save our sugar content per cereal cup as a column in our existing dataframe. 
We established the operation for this is:


```{python}
df['sugars']/df['cups']
```

Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

Now we combine it with `assign()` naming the column `sugar_per_cup`.

```{python}
df = df.assign(sugar_per_cup=df['sugars']/df['cups'])
df.head()
```

Give it a shot in the exercises now on your own.
