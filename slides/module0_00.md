Notes:
By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:
1. Define tidy data and explain why it is an optimal format for data analysis.
1. Transform data into the tidy data format using pandas.
1. Explain the relationship between numpy.ndarray, pandas.series and pandas.dataframe objects.
1. Move data fluidly between these object types (within one language).
1. Read data  into Python data from vanilla (e.g., .csv) and non-standard plain text files, as well as common spreadsheet file types (e.g., .xls).
1. Manipulate a single data table by:
  * Filtering rows based on a criterion or combination of criteria
  * Selecting variables
  * Creating new variables and modifying pre-existing ones
  * Rearranging the observations or variables in a deliberate way (e.g., sorting)
1. Manage and manipulate data with dates and times, missing values and categorical variables as well as renaming data frame columns.
1. Use the split-apply-combine approach to iterate over and summarize data by groups.
1. Translate fundamental programming concepts such as loops and conditionals into Python code.
1. Understand the key data structures in Python.
1. Understand how to write functions and assess if they are correct via unit testing.
1. Produce human-readable code that incorporates best practices of programming and coding style.
