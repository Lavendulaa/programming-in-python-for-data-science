## Arguments 

We have talked about quite a few different arguments when reading in different file types such as `index_col`, `delimiter` and for excel files `sheet_name` but there are many others that are important to know so we can to read in the file the way we want it to appear in our code. 

To recap from the last module, `index_col` is an argument that indicates which column will be acting as our index label.  In most of the cases we have encountered, it was the very first column. 

We are going to introduce a few: 

- `header`
- `nrows`
- `usecols`
- `true_values` and `false_values`

If you wish to know more, you can find the documentation at the following links:

- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html" target="_blank">`pd.read_csv()`</a>
- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html" target="_blank">`pd.read_excel()`</a>

      
_Please note that these arguments can be used for both `pd.read_csv()` and `pd.read_excel()`._

## header

We have been lucky up until now that all the data we have loaded in has been particularly straight forward.  Sometimes with data, there are a few lines of text explaining a few important points about the file.  We do not want to include this in our dataframe and therefore we need to specify exactly when our dataframe begins.  This is where `header` comes in. 
Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/MCL-DSCI-511-programming-in-python/blob/master/slides/candybars-h.csv" target="_blank">`candybars-h.csv` file </a> as an example.

If we look at the data with a regular text editor, the data doesn't start until line 3 which would be the equivalent of position 2 (since we begin at index 0).

If we load this data in without any arguments this is the result. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-h.csv')
candybars.head()
```

We see that there are no clear column names and things are in quite a disarray.

---

We use `header=2` to indicate where our dataframe begins. (2 being the index position the column labels)

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-h.csv', header=2)
candybars.head()
```

That's looking much better.

## nrows

nrows is useful when you only want to load in a portion of a file.  Perhaps the file you have is large and you only want a sample of it.  `nrows` will limit the of rows of file to read. 
Take our regular `candybar.csv` file but perhaps we only want 7 of the rows. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', nrows=7)
candybars
```

## usecols

Similarly to how `nrows` specifies how many rows to read in, `usecols` selects which columns to load from the data.  Perhaps the only columns relevant to our analysis are the columns `name`, `weight` and `available_canada_america`.  We can forgo the other columns when reading the data in. 
The `usecols` argument accepts either index positions or labels.  We put the desired column index positions in square brackets for the argument. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', usecols=[0, 1, 10])
candybars
```

Or we could use the column labels, also in square brackets.

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', usecols=['name', 'weight', 'available_canada_america'])
candybars
```

## true_values and false_values

These 2 arguments can be useful if we want to add some clarity in our dataframes. 
Bringing in new `candybars-tf.csv` we have several columns that have binary values of `yes` and `no` such as ` chocolate`, `peanuts`, `caramel` and `nougat`. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-tf.csv' )
candybars
```

We can change these values to something more familiar to the Python programming language such as `True` and `False`.

<html>

  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

To change the `yes` values to `True` and the `no` values to `False` we need to specify **BOTH** arguments with the values we wish to change in square brackets. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-tf.csv', true_values= ['yes'], false_values= ['no'] )
candybars
```

This is now more familiar to Python.  


Notes: Script here.
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We can also specify multiple values as either `True` or `False`.

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-tf.csv', true_values= ['Canada', 'Both'], false_values= ['America'] ) 
candybars
```

Now all the `Canada` and `Both` values have been converted to `True` and `America` values to `False`.
