## Arguments 

We have talked about quite a few different arguments when reading in different file types such as `index_col`, `delimiter` and for excel files `sheet_name` but there are mant others that are important to know so we can to read in the file the way we want it to appear in our code. 

To recap from the last module, `index_col` is an argument that indicates which column will be acting as our index label. In most of the cases we have encountered, it was the very first column. 

We are going to introduce a few: 

- `header`
- `nrows`
- `usecols`
- `true_values` and `false_values`

If you wish to know more, you can find the documentation at the following links:

- [`pd.read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html) 
- [`pd.read_excel()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html)
      
_Please note that these arguments can be used for both `pd.read_csv()` and `pd.read_excel()`._

## header

We have been pretty lucky up until now that all of the data we have loaded in has been particularly straight forward. Sometimes with data, there are a few lines of text explaining a few important points about the file. We do not want to include this in our dataframe and therefore we need to specify exactly when our dataframe begins. This is where `header` comes in. 
Take the next file as an example `candybars-h.csv`.  

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-h.csv')
candybars.head()
```

We see that there are no clear column names and things are in quite a disarray.

If we look at the data with a regular text editor, the data doesn't start until line 3 which would be the equivalent of position 2 (since we begin at index 0).

We use `header=2` to indicate where our dataframe begins.

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-h.csv', header=2)
candybars.head()
```

## nrows

nrows is useful when you only want to load in a portion of a file. Perhaps the file you have is large and you only want a sample of it. `nrows` will limit the of rows of file to read. 
Take our regular `candybar.csv` file but perhaps we only want 7 of the rows. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', nrows=7)
candybars
```

## usecols

Similarly to how `nrows` specifies how many rows to read in, `usecols` selects which columns to use in the dataframe. Maybe all that's relevant to our analysis are the columns `name`, `weight` and `available_canada_america`. 
Do you remember when we were selecting columns using `iloc` in the last module we would specified the index position? We use a similar syntax here. We put the desired column index positions in square brackets for the argument. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', usecols=[0,1,10 ])
candybars
```

## true_values and false_values

Here are 2 arguments that can be useful if we want to add some clarity in our dataframes. 

Bringing in new `candybars-tf.csv` we have a number of columns that have binary values of `yes` and `no` such as ` chocolate`, `peanuts`, `caramel` and `nougat`. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-tf.csv' )
candybars
```

We can changes these values to more direct values such as `True` and `False` since these are more familiar to our Python programming Language.

---

In order to change our `yes`'s to `True` and the `no`s to `False` we need to specify **BOTH** arguments with the values in square brackets. 

```{python}
candybars = pd.read_csv('candybars-tf.csv', true_values= ['yes'], false_values= ['no'] )
candybars
```

This is now more familiar to Python. For these arguments, mmultiple values can also be specified too.
