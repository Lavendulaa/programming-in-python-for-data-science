If we want to visualize things using different plots we can do that pretty quickly and with little code! Take `manufacturer_freq` object we made in the last deck of slide.

```python
freq_mfr_df
```

```out
       
          
```

 This would be great to express as a bar chart. But how do we do it?!

1. We take the dataframe we wish to plot, in this case `freq_mfr_df`.    
2. Next we add `.plot` since we want to plot it!   
3. But what kind of plot do we want?! A bar chart in this case would work nicely so lets add `.bar()` after that 

```python
freq_mfr_df.plot.bar();
```

```out
      
         
```

The important things to notice here is that we want to `.plot` a `.bar()` graph. 
You may have noticed also this `;` after the code. this just prevents an additional unnecessary output such as 

```
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1227555c0>
```
which we don't really need.

What else can we plot from our original cereal dataframe named `df`? Maybe we want to see the relationship between `calories` and `rating` in cereals?    
This would require a `scatter` plot! 
In the code we would need to specify the x and y axis which means we would need to specify the column names for each axis.  

```python
df.plot.scatter(x='sugars',y='calories');
```

```out
       
          
```

Something you may have noticed is that there are 77 cereals but there doesn't seem to be 77 data points! That's because some of them are lying on top of each other with the same sugar ar calorie values. It may be of use to set an opacity to the graph to differential those points. Opacity is set with the argument `alpha` and accepts values between 0 and 1, 1 being full intensity.  

```python
df.plot.scatter(x='sugars',y='calories', alpha= 0.3);
```

```out
       
          
```

Look at that! Now we can see there are multiple cereals that have 2.5g of sugar with 100 calories. 
What if we wanted to change the colour to purple? Enter parameter `c`! We can also add a bit of readability by separating the arguments into separate lines. 

```python
df.plot.scatter(x="sugars", 
                y="calories", 
                alpha= .3, 
                c = "purple");
```

```out
       
          
```

Those data points look pretty small. To enlarge them, the argument `s` should do the trick. Also every good graph should havew a title! Let's take this opportunity to finish off this graph and set the argument `title` to something as well. 

```python
df.plot.scatter(x="sugars",
                y="calories",
                alpha= 0.3, 
                c="purple",
                s= 50, 
                title = "The relationship between sugar and calories in cereals");
```

```out
       
          
```
