## What is Chaining?

Up until now, when we perform multiple actions on an object, we have been saving the results under a new object name. 
Chaining allows us to do multiple actions in a single line of code without the need to save each action in an intermediate object. 

You can imagine that we are linking verbs together similar to a chain.

When we made our frequency table in Module 1, we first saved the single column as an object before we used `value_counts()`.
Instead of saving the column in advance, we can skip this step and do this and the frequency table in one line with chaining:

```{python}
df['mfr'].value_counts()
```

The convinience doesn't stop there either.

Chaining is the design of performing each method in a sequential manner. 
Let's say we want to perform 3 actions:     
  
1. Filter the dataframe for cereals only from manufacturer "K".       
2. Select the columns `calories`, `sugars` and `rating` using the verb `loc`.       
3. Find the mean of each column using `.mean()`.     

Normally our code would look like this:
```{python}
mfr_k = df[df['mfr'] == 'K']
csr_df = mfr_k.loc[ : , ["calories", "sugars", "rating"]]
cereal_mean = csr_df.mean()
cereal_mean
```

Instead we can chain them:
```{python}
cereal_mean = df[df['mfr'] == 'K'].loc[ : , ["calories", "sugars", "rating"]].mean()
cereal_mean
```

This chain avoided the use of 2 intermediate objects; `mfr_k` and `csr_df`.

We can cut out creating intermediate variable which is great but now we just have a really long line of code and it's a bit hard to read.

How can we make this easier to understand?     
In this course, we suggest giving a new line for each verb  We can do this by wrapping our code in parentheses and making a new line before each period (` . `).  It's a good habit to indent and have the verbs lined up for additional clarity. 

```{python}
cereal_mean = (df[df['mfr'] == 'K'].loc[ : , ["calories", "sugars", "rating"]]
                                   .describe()
                                   .head()
              )
```
