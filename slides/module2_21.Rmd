# Grouping and Aggregating

Often, we are interested in examining specific groups in our data.  Perhaps the question we want to answer is:       
_*Which manufacturer has the highest mean sugar content?*_

We found out in previous section using `.value_counts()` that there were 7 different manufacturers; "K", "G", "P", "R", "Q", "N" and "A".

```{python}
df['mfr'].value_counts()
```

</audio></html>

---

To find the mean sugar content of each manufacturer, we could filter on each manufacturer and calculate the mean sugar content using `.mean()`.  We can  chain to make this process a little faster too.

Let's start with K:
```{python}
df[df['mfr'] == 'K'].mean().loc['sugars']
```

Next "G":

Let's start with K:
```{python}
df[df['mfr'] == 'G'].mean().loc['sugars']
```

We could do this for the remaining 5 manufacturers; however, this is not ideal. It's already taking quite a bit of time and it' seem like a lot of work to do this another 5 times.   Imagine how tedious this would be if we had 100 different manufacturers?

# Using groupby

Pandas has a solution for this.  It's not uncommon to be interested in examining specific groups in our data hence there is a verb helpful in grouping like-rows together.  `df.groupby()` allows us to group our data based on a column.

Let's group our candybars dataframe on the `mfr` column and save it as object `mfr_group`.

```{python}
mfr_group = df.groupby(by='mfr')
mfr_group
```

This returns a `DataFrame GroupBy` object.  What exactly is this?

---

A `DataFrame GroupBy` object contains information about the groups of the dataframe.  We can access it with the `.groups` attribute (noun).

```{python}
mfr_group.groups
```

Reading carefully, we can see there are 7 groups: `A`, `G`, `K`,  `N`, `P`, `Q` and  `R`, and it lists the index labels (cereal names) in each group.

Notes: Script here

<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We can obtain all the row index names of a group by specifying the group name in square brackets after the `groups` method.  Take the group `K` as an example.
```{python}
mfr_group.groups['K']
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

We can get the full dataframe of the group `K` alone using the method `get_group()`.

```{python}
mfr_group.get_group('K')
```

## Summary Statistics with Groups

What now?  This doesn't answer our initial question of _*Which manufacturer has the highest mean sugar content?*_     
Where do we go from here?      
We need to calculate the mean sugar content in each manufacturing group!

```{python}
mfr_group.mean()
```

This answers the initial question and confirms that manufacturer "P" has the highest mean sugar content across cereals.  See how convenient this was to do in comparison to our initial method?  Not only does this give us the result quicker, but it also gives us the mean of each column of the dataframe.  Think of how many filtering and mean calculations would have to be done if we were to do this using our initial method.

Of course, using groups is not limited to finding the only the mean, we can do the same thing for other statistics too like `.min()` and `.max()`.

## Aggregating dataframes

In situations where we want to collect multiple statistics together, we can aggregate them in 1 step using is a verb called `.agg()`.

`df.agg()` can be used on its own using a single measurement, without groupby:

```{python}
df.agg('mean')
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

This is essentially the same thing as calling the statistic `mean()` on the dataframe.

```{python}
df.mean()
```

Notes: Script here

<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

`df.agg()` gets a chance to really shine when we want several specific measures.  Let's say we want the `max`, `min` and `median`.  We specify them in square brackets within our `df.agg()` method.

```{python}
df.agg(['max', 'min', 'median'])
```
It produces a convenient 
dataframe giving the value for each statistic, for each column.

## Aggregating groupby objects

`df.agg()` is particularly useful with groupby objects.  Let's try it on our manufacturer  `groupby` object named `mfr_group`.

```{python}
mfr_group.agg(['max', 'min', 'median'])
```

This gives a value for each group and for each statistic we specified.

</audio></html>

## Extra Fancy Aggregation

You might have noticed that when we used `df.agg()`,  we calculated the same 3 statistics for every column in the dataframe.
This doesn't have to be the case.  We can calculate different statistics for different columns. 

Let's say we are concerned about the `max` and `min` calorie values, the total `sum` of the ratings and the `mean` and `median` sugar content for each manufacturing group. 
We wrapped everything in curly brackets and we use a colon to separate the column name from the statistics values. We need to put the statistics within square brackets. 

```{python}
mfr_group.agg({"calories": ['max', 'min'],
                 "rating": ['sum'],  
                 "sugars": ['mean', 'median']})
```

Now this is a bit easier to read.
