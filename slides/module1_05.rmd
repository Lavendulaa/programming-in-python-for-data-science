Congratulations on writing your first code! This is great! We have read in our data and know the dimensions. What now? Let's go over how we would **index**, **slice** and  **select** certain columns or rows of our data.

## Cereal Data

Let's import pandas and bring in our dataset named `cereal.csv` using the name of the candy bar as the index like we did last time with `index_col=0`.


```{python }
import pandas as pd
  
df = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv', index_col=0)
df.head()
```

## Indexing Dataframes
    
We can see 7 of the 15 columns of the dataframe and the first 5 rows of the data.
Let's say we only want certain rows of the whole dataframe or certain columns.

We talked about how `df.head()` will generate the first few rows (5 as default) of a dataframe but what if we wanted rows 5-10?

The first column of this dataframe is called the `index`. This is what we specified with `index_col=0` when we read in our data. Each row is given a label as well as a position. In this case, the label of an observation is the cereal name and the index position is a number. In other cases, the index label could be named with a number.

Here are the first 15 rows of the dataframe: 

```{python}
df.head(15)
```

Let's talk about the observation named `Almond Delight`.  Its index label is `Almond Delight` but its index position is 4.    
If you just went and counted those again and started screaming "5! It's the fifth position", that's ok. In the Python language, we start counting at position 0 (then 1, 2, 3, and 4 for Almond Delight).

So now let's say we want 5 rows past `Almond Delight`. That means we want rows with the index labels `Apple Cinnamon Cheerios` to `Cap'n'Crunch`.  

```{python}
df.loc[ "Apple Cinnamon Cheerios" : "Cap'n'Crunch"]
```

```df.loc[ "Apple Cinnamon Cheerios" : "Cap'n'Crunch"]```

This essentially means the _dataframe location from `Apple Cinnamon Cheerios` to `Cap'n'Crunch`._

Now what if we only wanted certain columns now?

Perhaps we were only interested in the `calories` to `fiber` columns of those rows?


```{python}
df.loc[ "Apple Cinnamon Cheerios" : "Cap'n'Crunch", "calories" : "fiber"]
```

`loc` is used to slice columns and rows by **label** and within an interval.
The general format to slice both rows and columns together looks like this:

```python
`df.loc[ row-name-start : row-name-end , "column name start" : "column name end"]`
```
