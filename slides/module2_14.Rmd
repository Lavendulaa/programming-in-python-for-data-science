## What is Chaining ?

Up until now, when we want to perform mutiple actions on a object we have been saving each new object under a new object name. 
Chaining allows us to do multiple actions in a single line of code without these intermediate object. 

You can imagine that we are linking verbs together similar to a chain.

When we made our frequency table in Module 1, we first saved the single column as an object before we used `value_counts()` 
We can do this all in one line with chaining:

```{python}
df['mfr'].value_counts()
```

However, this is not the extent of chaining. Before we move forward, it's important we know the difference between functions and mathods.

## Methods vs Functions 

Chaining is used specifically with methods and cannot be used with functions. We have made the comparison that attributes can be compared to nouns, while methods and functions are compared to verbs. 
But what makes these two verbs different? 


**Functions**: Execute an action.       
**Methods**: Are functions that execute an action but are associated with an object.      

Let's compare the function`pd.read_csv()` with the method `head()`.

In `pd.read_csv()` we add an argument instructing the file name we wish to bring in.    
Example:    
```
pd.read_csv('cereal.csv')
``` 
`head()` requires an object, specifally a dataframe, in order to execute. 
Example:      
```
df.head()
```

Methods generally have the form `object-name.method()` whereas function can take in arguments that don't necessarily have to be objects. 
Functions will have the form `function-name(argument)`.  

Here is an example of how a function does not need an object. `abs()` is a function that will return the absolute value of a number. `abs()` takes in an argument - in this case, a number and not an object. 

```{python}
abs(-6)
```

Chaining is the design of performing each method in a sequential manner. 

Here is an example where we perform 4 actions all in a single chain. 
1. Filter our dataframe for cereals only from manufacturer "K"
2. We select the columns `calories`, `sugars` and `rating` using the method `loc` 
3. We then use the `describe` method to find some summary statistics
4. `head()` is the final method used to obtain the first 5 rows of the describe dataframe


```{python}
df[df['mfr'] == 'K'].loc[:, ["calories", "sugars", "rating"]].describe().head()
```

This chain avoided the use of 3 intermediate objects.

Ok so great, we can cut out creating intermediate variable but now we just have a really long line of code that's a bit hard to read! 

How can we make this easier to understand?     
In this course we suggests giving a new line for each method. We can do this by wrapping our code in parentheses and making a new line before each period. It's good practice to indent and have the methods line up to make it espectially clear. 

```{python}
(df[df['mfr'] == 'K'].loc[:, ["calories", "sugars", "rating"]]
                     .describe()
                     .head()
)
```
