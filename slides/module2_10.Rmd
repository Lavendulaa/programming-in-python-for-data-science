Remember our `candybars.csv` dataframe?  Let's bring it back. 


```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv', index_col=0)
df
```

## Column Renaming

There will be times where you are unsatisfied with the column names and you may want to change them.  The proper syntax to do that is with `df.rename()`.    
The column named `available_canada_america` is a bit long.  Perhaps it would be a good idea to change it something shorter like `availability`. 
Here is the code to do that:


```{python}

df = df.rename(columns={'available_canada_america' : 'availability'})
df.head()

```


This code uses something we've never seen before - {} curly brackets.
These have a special meaning but for now, you only need to concentrate your attention on the fact that the argument `columns` needs to have the format:

```
 columns={'old-column-name' : 'new-column-name'}
```

---

You can also rename multiple columns at once by simple adding a comma between the new and old column pairs between the curly brackets. 

```{python}
df = df.rename(columns={'available_canada_america' : 'availability',
                        'weight' : 'weight_g'})
df.head()
```

## Column Creation 

Creating a new column is extremely useful when we need to add additional information.  Perhaps we want to convert the weight from grams to ounces.  We can add that to our current dataframe using the `assign` function and naming the column `weight_oz`.    
First we are going to save the conversion factor of ounces to grams in an object named `g_to_oz`. 

```{python}
g_to_oz = 28.3495
```

If we reference any of the dataframe's columns in the the creation of a new column, we use single square brackets. 

```{python}
df = df.assign(weight_oz= df['weight_g']/g_to_oz)
df
```

It's important that we always save the dataframe to an object when renaming or adding a new column or the changes will not be saved in our dataframe.

On the topic of making new columns, we can sum multiple columns in a dataframe and assign the results to a new column. Perhaps we want a column named `ingredients` which shows the total number of ingredients. This could be calculated by taking the sum of the columns from `chocolate` to `white_chocolate`. We can do this in two ways. 

The long way:

```{python}
df.assign(ingredients= df['chocolate'] +  df['peanuts'] + df['caramel'] +
                       df['nougat'] + df['cookie_wafer_rice'] + df['coconut'] + df['white_chocolate'])
```

---

The faster way!

```{python}
df.assign(ingredients= df.loc[: , 'chocolate' : 'white_chocolate'].sum(axis=1))
```

 We have seen `df.loc[: , 'chocolate' : 'white_chocolate']` before and we know that this means we are selecting all the rows of a dataframe and only the columns between `chocolate` and `white_chocolate`. We have seen `df.sum()` calculate the sum of each dataframe column.
`axis=1` is new to us and simply means that instead of calculating the column total, it calculates the row total.

## Column Dropping 

Ok, so we know how to create a new column but what if I want to drop one or multiple columns? While `df.assign()` creates columns, `df,drop()` will delete selected columns.
Let's delete the column `weight_oz` that we just made. 


```{python}
df.drop( columns= 'weight_oz')
```

If you scroll back to the last slide you'll notice we didn't save over the dataframe so the dataframe `df` still will contain `weight_oz`.

```{python}
df.head()
```

Let's overwrite this and remove `weight_oz` and `coconut` together. We  put the columns we want to drop in square brackets. 

```{python}
df = df.drop(columns=['weight_oz', 'coconut'])
df.head()
```
