# Reshaping using pivot

`pandas` provides 2 functions for reshaping data:   

-  <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.melt.html" target="_blank">`.melt()`</a> to make a wide dataframe long (convert columns to row) 
- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html" target="_blank">`.pivot()`</a>  to make a long dataframe wide (convert rows to columns)

## Pivot

`.pivot()` can be used in situations where our data may not meet criterion #2: _ Each variable is a single column_

It can be used to then elongate the dataframe: to convert the variables to their own columns that were previously being stored in a single column.

The code for this verb takes quite a few arguments that can be a bit tricky so we are going to go through it. 

  ```
  df.pivot(index=['index label'], columns='column_name', values='new_colum_name')
  )
  ```
  
  - `df` to express with dataframe we want to pivot
  - `index` is going to be use to make the new dataframe's index. 
  - `columns` is the column that currently exists but that we want to create new columns labels from. Each unique value in this column will become a new column label. 
  - `values` is the name of the column that currently exists but that contains the cell values we want. These values will be display in the respective newly created columns.

We must take care with the `index` argument when transforming dataframes. This argument will only accept column labels and not column index labels. 
Before we do any type of transformation, it's a good idea to reset and remove and labels an an index.   
This can be done with `.reset_index()`
This converts the index to a regular column. 
 On our trusty cereal dataset, we see the name column as our index and we can reset it by calling `.reset_index()`
```{python}
cereal.head()
```

```{python}
cereal.reset_index().head()
```

The process of pivoting and it's argument can be explained well using the animation made by Alison Presmanes Hill “Source: Alison Presmanes Hill,

Let's try an example. Our cereal dataframe has information on 77 different cereals,
```{python include=FALSE}
cereal = pd.read_csv('cereal.csv', index_col=0)
again = cereal.reset_index().melt(id_vars=['name','fat', 'sodium', 'fiber', 'carbo', 'potass', 'vitamins', 'shelf', 'weight', 'cups', 'rating'], value_vars=['protein', 'calories', 'sugars'], var_name="nutrition", value_name="measure").set_index('name')
cereal_long= again.sort_index()
```

```{python}
cereal
```

</audio></html>

---

Our amended one that we want to tidy looks like this:
```{python}
cereal_long
```

We can see there are 231 rows and the `nutrition` column is made up of 3 variables; `protein`, `calories` and `sugar`. That means there are 3 rows for each of the 77 cereals. This explains why this untidy dataframe contains 231 rows (77 cereals * 3 variables = 231 rows).

To transform this into tidy data we would specify the following arguments.    
- Indicate `index` as the `name` column.    
- Target the column `nutrition` with the values contained as new columns labels.     
- Specify `measure` as the values associated with each of the new columns.       

Also we can't forget to reset the index! (Just like any other dataframe, if we want to keep the changes, makes sure to assign it to an object)


```{python}
(cereal_long.reset_index()
            .pivot(index='name', columns='nutrition', values='measure')
            )
```

And now we are back to 77 rows and it looks like we've tidied our data up! There appears to be a  problem though.
`pivot` works well when we are only concerned with the columns we are pivoting but as we can see we lot all our other columns in the dataset. 
There is a solution for this and it's called `.pivot_table()`
