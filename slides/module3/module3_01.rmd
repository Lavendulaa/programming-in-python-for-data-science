# Tidy Data

When we first hear "tidy data", you likely think of clean, organized and orderly data. The same applies here however the concept of ***Tidy Data*** stems from <a href="https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf" target="_blank">`a paper written by Hadley Wickham in 2014`</a>. 

### What is the concept of tidy data?

A tidy data is one that is satified by these three criteria:  

- Each row is a single observation,
- Each variable is a single column, and
- Each value is a single cell (i.e., its row, column position in the data frame is not shared with another value)

What is a variable and an observation may depend on your immediate goal.

We tidy our data in such a way so that we can create a standard across multiple analysis tools. 
It changes the focus from the figuring out the logistics of getting the data a certain way, to answering the actual analysis question being asked.  

This standard now sets precedent for the input arguments of certain analysis verbs (like `.describe()` and other predictive methods).

Let's explore some different versions of our cereal dataset and determine if they fit the "tidy" criteria. 

Selecting a few rows from out unaltered cereal dataset, does it fit all three criteria?

## Criterion #1
_Each row is a single observation_ 

<center><img src="module3/tidy-crit1.png" width="550" /></center>

From the dataframe we can see that each cereal has it's own row. Criterion #1 is met!

---

## Criterion #2
_Each variable is a single column_ 

<center><img src="module3/tidy-crit2.png" width="550" /></center>

From the dataframe we can see that each of the variables `name`, `mfr`, `calories` and `sugar` have their own column. We can validate that criterion #2 is also met.

## Criterion #3
_Each value is a single cell_ 

<center><img src="module3/tidy-crit3.png" width="550" /></center>

The variable value for each cereal has it's own cell, confirming that criterion #3 is met!

As expected, the cereal data we have been working with is **"Tidy Data"**. 
Let's look at a example where this is not the case.

## Criterion #1
_Each row is a single observation_ 

<center><img src="module3/tidy2-crit1.png" width="500" /></center>

From the dataframe we can see that each observation has it's own row. There are 2 rows per cereal but each row is unique. 
We can confirm that criterion 1 is met.

## Criterion #2
_Each variable is a single column_ 

<center><img src="module3/tidy2-crit2.png" width="500" /></center>

It looks like we have a problem here. In this dataframe, two of our variables are contained in a single column. This is making the data untidy and difficult to work with and we would need to transform it.

At this point you may be asking yourself the question _"Are there any verbs using pandas, that would easily convert the `Nutrition` column into it's separate variables?"

If you are, then you are ahead of the game! We will discuss this in the next section!
