# Concatenating

Up until this moment, we have been working with a single dataframe. Single dataframe can we great to see all your data in one convinient place, however this is less convinient when it comes to storage space. Many company's split their data into multiple tables and join them together depending on what columns they need for their analysis.  
There are 2 different verbs we use for joining dataframes together: 

- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html" target="_blank">`.concat()`</a>; A forceful way of joining dataframes across rows or columns. A useful analogy is the glueing or taping of 2 pieces of paper together so the shapes match up. 
- <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.merge.html" target="_blank">`.merge()`</a> A more precision based approach for combining data on common columns or indices. This can be compared to stiching fabric together so that the pattern/print lines up.

## Concatenation 

Of the way to combine dataframes, and if we are comparing this to crafting,  concatenation takes less skills. Don't confuse this with not being useful though. 
Concatenation works extremely well when you have similar dataframe where either both dataframes share identical column or row index labels.  
`.concat()` does not look at the column or row labels to which the dataframes are being glued before hand. If both data frames shat the same d

Believe it or not but you have already seen this concepts when we explained the concept of grouping and aggregating. 

```{python}
cereal.groupby('mfr').agg(['max', 'min'])
```

Here you can see that each of the original cereal dataframe columns have subcolumns `max` and `min` and that there a hierarchy of index labels.

## Setting indexes 

In the last section you learned how to set a single index using `.set_index()`. Here we are going use the same verb but set `caramel` AND `name` as the indexes from the candy dataframe. 
Remember in the last section where we explained that `pandas` doesn't recognize indexes as columns and we needed to `.reset_index()` to makes sure we has all the columns in our dataframe? The same applies here, we are going to avoid resetting by reading the data without assigning any index with the `index_col` argument. 
```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('candybars.csv')
```

---

Next we can assign multiple indexes using square brackets within the `.set_index()` verb and sort the dataframe according to the index using verb `sort_index()`. (`.sort_index()` is similar to `.sort_values()` however now we can sort by the index!)

```{python}
df2 = df.set_index(['caramel', 'name']).sort_index()
df2
```

To get the entire picture, the image belows shows the complete dataset. It almost looks like there are 2 separate dataframes on top of one another. The top dataframe containing non-caramel chocolate bars and the second dataframe containing caramel filled chocolate bars.

Some of you may now be asking "How do we select and slice now?". The answer is just like before but now we specify 2 indexes! 
To specify 2 indexes, we wrap them in parenthesis. 
Perhaps I wanted the non-caramel filled "3 Musketeers" bar. I would use `0` to represent the first index of "non-caramel filled" and `3 Musketeers` for the bar name.

```{python}
df2.loc[(0, '3 Musketeers')]
```

This works if I want a specific cell value too. Let's say I wanted the non-caramel filled "3 Musketeers" bar weight.

```{python}
df2.loc[(0,'3 Musketeers'), 'weight']
```

## Stacking 

If this organization is no ideal for your analysis you may want to *transpose* your data (swap columns to rows or rows to columns). This can be done with something called **Stacking**. Stacking is exactly what it sounds like, we _stack_ values. 

```{python}
stacked = df2.stack()
stacked
```

This dataframe now all the columns available in a single column and our dataframe has elongated from 25 rows to 225 rows.

## Unstacking 

```{python}
stacked.unstack()
```

Just for fun, let's bring back the example we used of hierarchical indexing involving our groupby cereal aggregated dataframe.

```{python}
cereal.groupby('mfr').agg(['max', 'min'])
```


Notes: Script here
<html>
<audio controls >
  <source src="placeholder_audio.mp3" />
</audio></html>

---

The dataframe is currently unstacked but we can stack the `max` and `min` values, to elongate the dataframe. 

```{python}
cereal.groupby('mfr').agg(['max', 'min']).stack()
```

This now shows the `max` and `min` values for each manufacturer on top of each other instead of side by side.  
Which way do you prefer?
